"The matchmaking is unbalanced. I’ve already tried uninstalling and reinstalling the game, but the connection keeps dropping randomly. After the latest update, the game gets stuck at 75% loading and never reaches 100%. I’ve cleared the cache and force-closed the app, but the issue still happens. Meanwhile, my internet connection is very stable and fast when using other apps.",1,2025-10-25 18:13:01
"It's a great game overall, my biggest complaint is how pay to win the game can be, about 75 percent of the items in the shop are bought with money, which makes it so much easier to level up cards instantly. I don't like about paying for mobile games, so I've always been a free to play user. There's been some challenges against pay to win users, but nothing major if you manage to have good level cards",4,2025-10-10 07:47:17
As a free to play player with 8+ years I've seen this game change and grow. All the good stuff and the bad. It's a better state now then it was a few years ago. Some things are still not balanced but things have been shaping up recently. The competitive nature of the game feels lacking with no incentive to play ranked. As of recently they changed trophyroad and ranked once more linking the two. Hitting 15000 unlocks ranked and resets at the end of the season to 12000 which is a horrible change.,3,2025-09-25 07:00:28
"Money sucker! The game is fantastic. It's highly addictive once you get the feel of it. One thing which I found annoying is when you are in battle mode and you get matched against an opponent of higher your level. It's very difficult to beat them since the health of their cards is much more. Ergo, I wish if we get matched according to king tower levels in battle instead of number of trophies. That would be a level playing field. also, gameplay sucks on mobile internet. I hope creators fix it.",3,2025-04-20 03:02:42
"This was one of my favorite games. However, the recent update (early 2025) has reduced the how much gold you can get by so much, you can't hardly advance. Gold chests that were worth 25k - 30k now only seem to give about 4 or 5k, and several other reductions. I've bought the monthly royale pass thing for quite a while. I won't buy it anymore and will likely quit playing all together. Hopefully they'll change it back!!",2,2025-05-29 11:52:55
"Three words define the actual state of the game: unrewarding, frustrating and repetitive. Right now, Clash Royale has become the most frustrating and repetitive game of all. I'm quitting the game for good because I'm sick of going against the same annoying decks over and over again. there is a lack of balance and the recent updates and new cards really sucks. The only almost fun thing about the game was the 2x2 battles, but the devs get rid of it.",1,2025-07-24 19:44:25
After almost 7 years of playing and staying positive. The newest update just spells Pay to Win. For the past few years I always enjoyed Party mode over climbing a ladder with an unbalanced algorithm. Party mode was the only way I earn gold coins to level up to 14. You have taken that away to replace with Pay to Win Party mode. The max amount daily is capped at 1000 which is accomplished in a few rounds. You need to pay to collect double amount with a time limit. Who ask for this update?,1,2025-08-08 21:40:12
"I won't lie, Clash is a great is an amazing game to play. They now have two different gamemodes and they're both pretty fun to play. The only thing I'm not too happy about is the part where they removed the shop, the one that pretty much carried us free to play players in collecting evo's. Now we have to wait for events like this or gotta buy our way through the game.",4,2025-08-14 09:29:41
"Would be fun, which it is, if it wasn't horrible at finding wifi. Can't even go five seconds without disconnecting. Once I was in a battle and my enemy was winning and I could've defended it if this sad excuse of a game didn't boot me out. I have full bars on wifi and internet but then I go into the game and then I have like 1 bar or just none. It gets so bad that in fact, it works BETTER outside in the car... FIX YOUR STUPID GAMES, this also happens on CoC too.",2,2025-01-26 20:09:58
This is one of the best mobile games ever made. No ads. Vertical Gameplay. You can succeed without spending money (for the most part) and most importantly the community aspect of it. but I fear that supercells inability to keep 2v2s in the game makes this app a dumpster fire. I cant enjoy playing w my friends and im forced to face 1v1s against high level players w level 14 cards for some reason. It makes 0 sense why they wouldnt just keep 2v2s in the game. Its so confusing it angers me.,2,2025-07-22 02:01:36
"Within two updates they removed both the 2v2 and the ranked mode, giving you no more option for a fair and balanced matchmaking. This makes the game unplayable if you don't put in enough money to level your troops up to what is typical for your ladder points. Every match is either a clear win or loss right from the start, since it solely depends on what levels yours and the opponent's cards have.",1,2025-07-13 20:57:36
"I’ve played Clash Royale off and on for over 8 years and it was incredible at launch with fresh cards, exciting game modes and constant updates. However recent years have been disappointing with fewer content updates and an increased focus on pay-to-win microtransactions. It feels like the game is now geared toward those willing to spend money which ruins the balance and fun for long time players. It’s sad to see such an amazing game come to this but it still has potential if it listens to us.",2,2024-12-26 15:24:19
"It's an alright game, but with each update it gets worse. They release Evo's for cards that don't need it like the Mega Knight and Pekka which genuinely takes away from the experience. At first it was just a little annoying but now it's gotten to a point that you can't play casual 2v2 or 1v1 without running into an evo pekka, evo mega knight, with a sparky placed behind it or what have you. I guess it's just a bit annoying to see Supercell encourage a playstyle that makes the game boring",1,2024-09-16 02:19:45
"This is a really great game, very fun, but it can sometimes be frustrating losing the battles, especially if you're really close to the next arena and lose your trophies.",4,2024-12-27 05:39:07
"Honestly the game is shaping up to be more and pay-to-play every update. The developers hardly listen to the community and keep adding things no one wants. They removed many ways one could reasonably progress in the game without micro transactions. My verdict is that if you have an older account with a decent amount of progress you may get something out of playing it. However, if you're considering the game as a new player I suggest you do not get into it, at least not in it's current state.",1,2026-02-12 12:06:29
This game has always been fun. but at the same time there is numerous problems. I have experienced issues with disconnecting or glitching out. The first problem about this is if you do lag out they still count the trophy loss I see this unfair as most of the time it's not most people's fault. As the game continues on it gets frustrating as the game ignores recommendations from fans and players. Most of the time you will run into pay to wins. I don't recommend this game if you get mad easily.,1,2026-02-12 04:37:01
"Worst game! even if you have good network connection, the game got suddenly stop and restart between Matches, and the main issue is the game is not opening and stopped between 98-99% in loading screen. I got this prblm more than 1 week, even after doing all the things from uninstalling the game, restart the phone etc etc.. it is not working.. also, the game is money sucker. as a f2p player, It is next to impossible to make progression faster. Dogshit game, DON'T PLAY!",1,2026-02-14 00:25:46
"It's an awesome game, with plenty of room for leveling up, playing with friends, and progressing. Card are (mostly) balanced, and it is easy enough to learn. The 1 big problem this game has is that it can be hard to level up as a f2p, especially with all the paying people buying all these special offers and just laying waste to you. So def would recommend playing if you want a casual experience, but you may have to spend 5 dollars here and there if your impatient.",4,2026-02-09 08:41:41
"Do not play this game if you want to be free to play. The game is a never-ending treadmill of new ""content"" where paying players will always have an unfair advantage. Take heros for example, (something no one asked for or wants) through free to play methods unlocking them is completely rng, with a chance of getting a duplicate, and they are being added at a rate far faster than you can obtain them as f2p.",1,2026-01-30 15:11:45
"Don't bother. I've played this game on and off for quite a few years. It was very entertaining, and I enjoyed the play style but it is clear the developers are now focused on profit. The addition of evolutions certainly added an element of ""pay to win"". Evolutions are very difficult to collect, and the game is very clearly biased towards unlocking just a few of them. But they have now abandoned that subtle ""pay to win"" addition to the much more in your face Champions. Disappointed.",1,2026-02-07 02:32:06
"9 year badge. This was one of the best games I've ever played, and I still cherish the hours spent back when it was strategy based. Gave it another go after a 2 and a half year break. Like all great card games where cost to play is involved (elixir here), new mechanics or new cards costing less than their value ruining balance, destroying strategy based approach. Started with heroes and their abilities which weren't too awful compared to what it is now. Select units with abilities devalues them.",1,2026-01-30 05:19:49
"although the game mechanics and strategy is alright, they frequently add more to the game that severely limits the free to play experience, such as evolutions which take forever to get without paying for them, and the new heros, which are nearly impossible to get without spending money. Even without this, the ability to spend money to upgrade cards makes it all the more difficult to progress when you are fighting people with cards 2 levels higher. overall, this game is not free to play friendly.",3,2026-02-05 04:07:20
"great game to play with friends and overall, but when you start to play a little bit more you can see that its a extremely pay to win game, climbing feels super heavy and progress is too slow. I have been playing for some time now and the recent updates are overdriving the pay to win, increasing the level on the cards that were already very hard to get, and I didn't even start to talk about the luck based progress, since the cards you get are random and probably aren't the ones you use.",1,2026-02-02 03:42:54
Played since launch and have always enjoyed the game which is amazing. Sadly the game is poorly managed. The over monetization is off the scale. 100% pay to win which is very sad. I consistently bought the battle pass and made purchases from the shop for years because I believe in supporting games that bring value. The excessive greed of the game management has driven off a lot of the core players and I won't be spending anything more as a result of this. Hopefully they get it together soon.,1,2026-02-03 12:52:33
"I’ve been playing this game for more than five years, and it has honestly been one of my favorite and most addictive games. For a long time, I had no complaints at all. The gameplay was fun, engaging, and always kept me coming back. However, over the past few months, things have changed. There have been a lot of updates, and unfortunately, many new items are now locked behind in-app purchases. On top of that they have serious login issue and doing the gameplay it losses the connection.",5,2026-02-15 10:53:34
I've been playing since the beginning. It is a great game that USED TO involve a lot of strategy. The latest updates made it COMPLETELY PAY TO WIN. It does not matter how good you are anymore but rather how much money you've spent to get lvl16/champs. Almost everyone I know has uninstalled the game because of this. If you're into spending thousands of dollars to just be able to play a game and be equal to your opponents then go on and download. A small amount of money would be ok but this....,1,2026-02-08 06:21:34
Just hit ultimate champion in this game. I had fun with it for the last 7 years. Me being a free to play player made this really hard. I thought the new update would kill the game but I found heros to add maybe more skill or at the very least new pushes to the game. Looking foward to the next season and recommend this to people with money or dedication. Lots of people like to say f2p in clash is impossible and to hit uc is unrealistic but it's very possible me doing that.,5,2026-01-26 11:07:35
"This used to be a go to entertaining game, the thrilling of live matching is still amazing. However, the recent changes have just made it a premium only game, everything demands real money, even having good levels don't make sense, collecting things like wild shards is a nightmare, getting a single card evolution is so damn difficult, cant even think of the whole deck. Hope the team does something better and give all the players a fair chance at play.",2,2026-02-14 19:12:42
"I've been playing this game every now and then for about 8 years. You will have a horrible time if you don't plan on paying a ton of money for in-game items. You want the new, ridiculously overpowered card to keep up? PAY. A few years ago, you could get a seasonal pass for 5€ which is still reasonable. Now, you have to pay 15€ a month for LESS rewards. Overall, I like the mechanics of this game, but Supercell is just a money hungry company that doesn't care about the playerbase at all.",1,2025-12-28 02:50:49
"The game is great! Except when it's not... Making the game easier for newer players is a great goal, but combining it with ZERO compensation for those who are already max level or close, while simultaneously removing one of the most important resources for late game players? A shot to the gut. It's also now more straightforward to ""pay to win"", with gems being able to be converted straight into cards. It makes it harder to be a casual player. Make pass $3.99, bring back books!",1,2025-12-31 02:57:03
"When I started playing clash,it was a great game. but now the game is WAY to pay to win, if you look at the shop, there are more offers then players at this point. there are also numerous cards that need to be nerfed such as mega knight boss bandit lumberloon witch ebarbs and so many more. overall the game has gone downhill since 2016 with the introduction of level 16 and hero cards. 10 years ago, I would recommend, but now not so much.",1,2026-01-21 13:00:26
"This game is extremely pay to win, which makes it unfun to play. Very often, you will encounter players with troops 2 levels higher or their King Tower's 2 levels higher, which are unbeatable 95% of the time. This leaves you with 2 options, invest money to upgrade your cards to equal the other players, or grind for weeks, possibly months to have an equal playing field. But then, once you do and start climbing, you will run into the same issue again. I wish I could write more about the game",1,2026-01-21 12:02:07
"This is actually a pretty cool game. Great way to kill a little time here and there. The reason for the low rating however is the recent changes to the game. Over the past few months I've spent far more than I should've to ""upgrade"" my deck but with the recent change they basically negated everything I spent. Which is fine but I will never spend another cent on this game. Overall I recommend playing but do NOT spend any money since its likely to just be wasted down the road.",1,2025-12-02 18:44:06
"not fun anymore. supercell kept removing things that rewarded a good amount of guaranteed cards or gold such as the season shop. now, everything is either RNG or P2W. now, just to get a singular card that you wanted, you have to spend several hours trying to get a card you want. Even though I don't remember it well, the chests were a better reward. You at least had an idea on what was in it. The hero update also ruined the game, as we haven't seen new evolutions in a while, which were balanced.",2,2026-02-15 09:58:22
"Very Pay to Win. If you don't spend real money on the game it will take FOREVER to level up cards. Every new update they add new ways to break the balance of the game. Progression to unlock heroes and evolutions takes lots of grinding and pure luck. Those who pay money can get them easily making the gap between p2w and f2p ginormous. The actual concept of the game is unique but due to all these problems it's kinda hard to ignore. Also, the devs don't listen to what the players want at all.",1,2026-02-06 10:39:55
"I've been off and on with this game for the past nearly 8 years, so I'd say I'm in a good position to talk. This game is so horrible now, either through it being so incredibly p2w and skill not being a factor anymore. Or its the absurd mechanic called ""tilting"" where the game purposely makes you lose through not putting you against the first player but rather a guaranteed loss. Another awesome thing is the devs just dont care about the player base at all. Don't play this game, its horrible.",1,2026-01-27 12:54:49
"The game doesn't revolve around strategy, just who has the higher cards level; most of basic interactions fail even with a few level difference which, in some cases, make the game nigh impossible to win. Continuously adding new evolutions and hero cards, which are barely obtainable as free to play, doesn't help either... if P2W was a game genre, this would surely be one of the top.",1,2025-12-27 17:44:04
"this is the most pay to win game I have ever seen, period. It doesn't even let you cancel out of the que. One time, I got let out of the que then got put into a game??? So obviously I lost that game. But if you face against someone over leveled it will be Extremely hard to win. And clash royale makes it really easy for someone to buy cards and gems to upgrade your cards.",1,2026-01-26 19:42:14
"The game used to be a lot of fun and a great way to pass time, but it has now devolved into a pay-to-win grind that is repitive and boring. The game itself is a lot of fun in the early stages, but it becomes incredibly stale, repitive and boring once you reach the higher arenas. Unless you're willing to spend hundreds of dollars, around Arena 18 the game becomes more ""hoping"" you dont run into a player that spent money to max everything out, but isn't skilled enough to climb any higher.",1,2026-01-02 23:13:03
"It was undoubtedly the best game I had ever played, capturing my heart and imagination with its immersive story and engaging mechanics that kept me coming back for more. However, over the last few years, the developers have complicated the experience significantly, introducing numerous changes and updates that have made it less enjoyable. Their primary focus seems to have shifted toward monetization, as they continually implement new features that require players to fork out additional money. It",1,2025-12-05 18:54:58
"It used to be fun, now it feels like a scam after Supercell got greedy. It takes more than a year to max out one deck, or hundreds of dollars. But that doesn't allow you to enjoy the game because you get locked into that deck. And the card and tower levels make a huge difference. They all cost a lot to upgrade. And even if you manage to get something together, Supercell will add a new level that is more costly than before. I've played for 6 years now, but it's become really disappointing.",1,2026-01-01 19:20:00
"This is my experience, I've been playing for 2 years, and throughout those 2 years, I've been decently satisfied, very addictive but frustrating, basically just gambling due to how matches are set up, it doesn't matter the card levels, it only matters if they are in the same arena as you, so you can have level 12s while someone has level 15s or 16s (has happened to me before), plus the current updates are all pay to win. Do not download this game, for your own sanity, and for the current boycott",1,2026-02-13 11:41:20
"The game can be fun and rewarding, such as playing challenges and unlocking achievements/ magic items to help you progress. However, everything that you earn through time & effort can simply be purchased with real money. You can become skilled & learn to play with your cards & decks, but alas, if your opponent has spent more money, your odds of winning are slim. Often letting the player feeling very stressed and overall a sour experience that doesnt want you to keep playing for more.",2,2026-01-11 09:46:14
"people who say its a good game are just casuals. This is a super p2w game, where you cant progress unless you pay for cards, levels and evolutions, so at some point it just stops being fun. They also seem to counter you with AI decks on purpose at some point to make sure you get stuck and lose. so to sum it up, fun at the beginning, but very quickly will become p2w, and even then it will be hard to progress",1,2026-01-10 23:09:04
"The Rise of Heroes? The Fall of Clash! Money Grab! I use to enjoy this game. I actually would spend the 11.99 a month. That was when it was worth what Super Cell was offering for upgrades to cards, and other goodies! Super Cell! You are literally killing it! The game,that is! I remember when you, the devs, actually listened to what we wanted. I don't think anyone likes this update. I think after 10 years, Clash Royale has run it's course.",1,2025-11-29 22:04:39
"Utterly disappointed with the game. I have been playing the game since release on multiple accounts. But now the game has gotten so bad, it has become a Pay 2 win. People who have bought the pass can easily upgrade their cards at a much faster rate and overpower normal users. Plus when you keep getting matched with these players, the game becomes so frustrating. Supercell, I am actually really disappointed with y'all.",1,2025-12-31 17:17:38
"The game is fun, somewhat addictive, and there's lots of variety. The matchmaking is absolute hot garbage, though. Getting paired with players who have cards 3 and 4 levels above your own is an absolute waste of time, and it's obvious that this is just a ploy to try and lure you into spending cash. Not gonna happen. And even if I entertained the idea of paying to play, the package values are insulting. Honestly, fix your game. Such wasted potential.",2,2025-12-02 10:12:23
"Don't get me wrong, I love clash royale. As a fairly new player, I took in heroes with an open mind. However, the way supercell is designing the hero boxes so you can barely get fragments, making paying for the heroes actually better value. The company is biting of more than they could chew with the addition of level 16, forcing free to play players to play against overleveled opponents. As much as I hate to say it, supercell must fix the game otherwise it will be well and truly dead.",3,2025-12-31 11:43:56
"I have been playing for 4 years and I hate how the game takes your progress away from you every new season. Example I had around 13,000 crowns. New season starts they knock me down to 10,000 crowns. When you pair up in a match its on purpose. The algorithm is set up for you to constantly loose which makes you play more. And when you pay for certain things, coins, gems or mote cards....then all of a sudden you start winning. Its literally a casino wrapped up in a battle style game.",1,2025-12-02 11:30:28
"I wrote a 4 star review in 2018. It is 2025 and had to lower my score... I played this game when it came out. Eventually I stepped away from. The game because as I said in my previous review, the game gives advantage to those who sink money into it. The recent update (Dec 2025) demonstrates the logical destruction programmers can have on a game. The trophy road that clearly distinguished the high level (maxed) players was broken. Game is unplayable right now.",2,2025-12-02 20:43:51
"game is okay, not bad, I do plan to keep playing but it is so obsurdly pay to win to the point where there's no point in playing sometimes, and there's also a bug where the events don't pop up in the game screen so I miss out in tons of free stuff and the shop and other things just never load, making it so unfair, please fix this supercell, edit: it fixed itself for about 3 days then went right back, I was about to get my free hero but now I can't because the event refuses to show, 0/10",1,2025-12-08 12:04:03

You've added a link to your website in the shop which was noted to avoid Google fees for purchases - more greed.

But after this ones release, it breaks the game. no skill necessary to use it. no matter how big your people, getting one shot on top of it taking 3 or more of my cards out with a single hit.

"The removal of the books has drastically slowed down F2P progression. Claiming that this made the progression system ""smoother"" is basically a bold-faced lie. I'm not a F2P player, but I stand firm against dishonest marketing tactics. The game itself is great; lots of content, no ads, good for quick game during breaks at work. Just dishonest marketing tactics that did not used to be here. I hope whoever is in charge takes a step back and becomes more honest with the players.",2,2026-02-12 00:29:46
"If I could give it a zero I would. I can't believe the amount of greed this company has came to. They updated it and took items I had been saving for a while to level up card and in compensation...... Some cards and some gems. These items were worth thousands of cards and I had been saving them for years, and on top of it they add a new card level right after they take the items I was going to use to level up.

"worst game ive ever played. The idea is great, but the matchup system is the worst matchup system ever. It purposefully matches you up against higher level opponents so you're stuck in a constant loss streak and you're forced to pay money to have a better chance at winning. It isnt about having fun anymore its all about monitary gain. trust me, dont download this game. It's good at first till it keeps matching you up against players who've payed money to gain an advantage over you. money grab.",1,2026-02-12 01:17:59

No-one asked for heroes, and NOBODY wanted level 16. It is a great game, but Supercell need to make their game less p2w.",4,2025-12-23 00:00:24
"Fun game but P2W. I've been playing for almost 10 years now if not. One thing that will never fail to amaze me, is how fast someone who pays will get cards. They release game changing updates every few months and the only way to keep up with the changes is $. If you are willing to overlook that for a fun strategy game. this is it. Just don't get invested in the climb. Person winning prolly has more max level cards.",2,2026-01-06 16:47:13
"To be honest this is the best mobile real time strategy game. Unfortunately Supercell has sold out and implemented thoughtless monetization features which make progression pointless by constantly moving the finish line. You better bet there will be a level 17, 18, 19, 20, etc. The level cap increase doesn't even come with new exciting features, it's literally the same thing but 1 level higher.

"Don't download. Unless you like spending hundreds of dollars to upgrade some virtual characters. The game used to be competitive, but now it's just a massive pay-to-win. The updates today (like heroes or level 16) are mainly to encourage players to buy more and more for them upgrades. And the matchmaking is practically rigged. You get paired with someone who actually has your same level or someone who spent 200$ for level 16 in the first arenas. Never reinstalling again.",1,2025-12-29 02:12:10
"I'm addicted, loving this Game . I said that in 2020, but now sometimes it's annoying. During games, the network is lost even on Wi-Fi and 5G networks. I hate this. Even in a winning match, sometimes one has to lose. I have screen recordings as well that I can share with you. Please fix it and make connectivity better. If there's a weak network, the game should not load.",3,2026-01-31 03:43:00
"Haven't played this game after the hero update. They added a new pay to win feature (that looks pixelated) without even finishing the last one (card evolutions). When you get higher up in the trophy ladder you face even more pay 2 win players. The matches are unbalanced and really unfair. The battle modes screen has been under maintenance for a long time. Don't know what's happening there. Also, play on android not PC or the game will crash.",2,2026-02-01 08:51:36
"The base concept of the game is very nice and it should have been a 10/10 game. But Supercell has ruined the entire game by removing anything and everything that might help a player play the game without spending any money. You don't get required cards when you need them, the heroes are next to impossible to obtain unless you pay up. Altogether, Supercell has succeeded in making a 10/10 game into this absolute trash of a game",1,2026-01-31 19:19:31
"A solid free to play game that has since gone downhill. The addition of evolutions impedes game balance significantly by giving paying players an advantage which coupled with the poor matchmaking (pitting players with multiple evos against those with none) toes the line of ""pay to win"". As a casual player, I personally don't like how progression is locked behind a competitive mode that punishes you for losing by deducting progress; the added pressure to win makes the game less enjoyable imo.",2,2026-02-04 12:17:56
"I loved this game when I first got it, but i was just clueless how much of a cash grab pay2win slop game it is. Every evo cost 12 dollars which is absurd, and champions are even worse. They have a ""Pass Royale"" every season which gives a broken evo and tons of rewards. Literally no one asked for champions, and they added them anyway. They are broken and stupid. I dont recommend installing. Don't waste your time and play something else",1,2026-02-02 05:55:11
What the heck is wrong with the game lately I am playing it on my internet and even though I have a nice connection it's showing network issues and it also takes too long to login the game it's a waste of time currently to play the game.. I am seriously disappointed with this server problem supercell... Seriously I have never faced an issue like this in brawl star.,1,2026-02-15 00:41:30
Before they added evolutions and heroes to the game it was balanced and it was more skill based. Now the game feels Pay to win because they release new heroes and evos every season with broken abilities and the season shop is most likely gone from the game and that was one of the only surefire ways to get wild shards. I would not recommend playing this p2w garbage.,1,2026-02-01 13:02:29
the game is designed fo be highly addictive. I was able to get to 6350 trophies without purchases in 2 weeks on skill. once there the only way to climb is by paying if you d9nt want to wait to level up your cards. the issue is they release new features like evolution or hero and then people at the 6k level are addicted and are weak and then make the purchase. its a terrible thing.,1,2026-02-10 13:50:39
"Initially, it was a fun game, perfect for killing boredom. But after the sudden hype, Supercell switched on dipping a fun experience for everyone and just bagging money. They made it a pay 2 win and for those wanting to have a free plying, fun time, it's not there anymore. No way to avoid match- ups against people who emptied their dad's credit card to win. Will even go further to say they ruined the game!",1,2026-02-07 22:20:00
the game is really good but it is becoming worse now. meanwhile now I lose 5 games out of 10. people play online games to chill but this game just makes me frustrated. I used to play a lot but now I have reduced the time. it is just a waste of time. I always lose 2 matches starting so that I need to play at least 10 matches to advance two steps. easily anyone could see this type of manipulation.,1,2026-02-09 11:47:44
"The game makes it impossible to advance after a certain point unless you pay to play. Also, the game claims it uses random match making, but its not. they intentionally pair you up against people who's decks you have a 0% chance of beating. it was a fun game in the beginning that's why they get 2 starts, but not anymore.",2,2026-02-13 09:44:10
this is one of thw worst games in you could possibly install on your phone e or whatever its a waste of storage! They waned my acount with 5 Years of playing the game and 10k trophies and not only that the game is so long and requires an insane amount of patience (im underating the amount of patience it takes) and now I hate this game i realy do but I took time to go back to it to write a review to let you know how bad this game is and do not install it. if there was a -100 stars I would do it.,1,2026-02-11 00:48:37
"Do not play!! Game use to be fun but every war we are always teamed against teams that are multiple levels above my entire clan. Never winning these makes it boring and pointless. Clams need to be same level and same card level, not let people lose multiple battles to stay battling low level wars I tried it again and it is all random. no strategy works, it is all luck of the deal now. total bs game. not worth time",1,2026-02-09 22:48:27
"The game used to be fun but in the last 2-3 years it has gotten way too focused on Pay2Win that after a point you either grind for months and when you reach your goal it was for nothing because ""balance"" changes come or a new card gets released that is too op and if you dont sunk way too much money on it you wont get very far.",2,2026-02-04 06:42:57
"I used to love this game. I played f2p for years and had fun despite not being able to max cards. Then they released slash royale and lvl 14. I maxed some cards and my friends were playing. I loved it. I was even buying pass royale for $5. But they needed more money, so they added lvl 15, and now 16, increased the price of pass royale, added a more expensive version, reduced rewards, added evos, then heroes which are impossible to get. I haven't spent a dime since. lvl 1 is dead. Game is p2w",1,2026-02-14 19:09:30
"Absolutely pay to win game. Really frustrating for free to play players to keep up. Hate the greedy game developers. Spoiled a really good game by turning into money making machine. U neither can grind ranked nor play for fun as a free to play player. Don't install the game right now, me myself got fed up and had to uninstall the game I absolutely loved due to this greedy supercell",1,2026-02-12 15:28:04
"the game is pay 2 win and it keeps getting worse with every update, while the gameplay is fun, the higher you climb the more money you need to spend and you can only play one deck since if you queue up you go against the same people at the same rank as your main deck. heroes was a horrible addition, before it took 3 seasons to get one evolution but now it will take 6 months to get a hero aswell. last season i bought the battlepass but the wrong battlepass was delivered.",1,2026-02-02 19:14:58
"as a free to play player, this was a very enjoyable game for a long time. unfortunately, over time supercell has made the game harder and harder to progress as a free to play player. with the recent addition of heroes, supercell has totally forgotten about other core parts about the game. and has made it much less enjoyable, so do not get into this game.",1,2026-02-07 23:38:03
"Started playing a few months ago and since then every update and change has made the game worse, you can't progress past a certain level without spending money. Some decks are just unbeatable I would be amazed if any of the Devs actually play the game.",1,2026-02-09 00:39:53
"This might be the biggest fumble I've ever seen in gaming. Being gifted MASSIVE player counts thanks to streamers and content creators, then doing what no one asked for except the greedy people at the top. Add level 16 so people need to pay more to get better, and Hero Cards, yet another Pay to Win method. I've been with this game since it's peak in 2016 and I've never seen the fan base's morale this low and neither have I ever seen a company this GREEDY.",1,2026-02-14 15:35:18
"Absolute disgrace of a game. I downloaded this game on the very first day of release. Went from F2P to P2P in the last few months.

I was a paid to play guy on this for a couple years I've been playing quite some time without the pay to play. either way all I can tell you is this if you pay attention you'll notice this game is very hard and is rigged which is what makes it hard this is literally the only game I play anymore and I'm literally thinking about just ditching it shame on the Developers for making this another Monopoly,1,2026-02-15 03:59:55
it's a game for quick timepass but omg even when I have good network the game takes hours to load and after every match the same case I have to wait for hours to load my device is also good but still this kind of problem. I open to game for a quick relax 5-10 min time pass but the loading only take 5-10mins of my time so what the point.....plsss fix this.,2,2026-02-14 14:18:57
"I already have a 6 yrs old account in this game. The worst match making ever seen in a game. The developers don't have the sense what match making is. The maximum time the opponent is at a higher level, both in towers as well as in cards. It's like the game is trying to cheat the player by giving such opponents. Please resolve this issue. But I'm quite sure the developers will not resolve it. Generally every old player uninstalls this game due to frustration.",1,2026-02-12 02:02:43
"It's a free app. But to try and compete, u have to BUY the pass.. even when u PAY for the monthly pass, it is NOW NOT GOOD ENOUGH. There's a more expensive pass to get cards effective enough to compete. Sad cause I enjoyed playing this game, but this is ridiculous. Edited. Used to be 3star but now I vote 1star, terrible terrible on this ad for Superbowl. Y'all have lost your minds. Terrible. Do not recommend",1,2026-02-07 12:50:40
"Don't bother downloading this game, it isn't what it used to be. Super Cell is a sell out company more worried about money than a quality game, while optional without spending you are basically doomed to fail and it's insanely repetitive. New players get 0 new content, free to play get 0 new content, it's a cash grab with bad graphics and poor adaptive potential for casual players or people who want to be good without breaking the bank.",1,2025-11-25 14:16:51
"Don't get me wrong, it's a good game, but it could be better. Especially with the fact that when you're at the top of an arena, they put you against bots that can counter your every move, and suddenly your plummeting down back to the bottom. I'd also like to mention the implementation of pay to win over the years, us free to play players are overwhelmed by people with maxed out troops that are impossible to beat, even if your strategy is borderline perfect there is nothing you can do. F2p forevr",3,2026-01-21 11:02:17
"I have played since the start and the gameplay is amazing but the game is let down by the very defensive nature of the game. This has not been addressed by level adjustments. tower damage needs lowering and a attack bonus given to attacking players. Also repetitive decks are a problem that needs fixing, by higher frequency stats adjustment. Also heros are just a pay to win as it takes ages to get enough tokens for non P2P players. Clan wars 2 should be scrapped it never worked",1,2026-01-31 17:52:51
"Here it goes again when I play Merge Tactics, when I'm in the Gold III, 2700 points and trying to reach 2800 points, that's where the rigging of the game itself happens. The shuffling of cards are so random that you can't even merge a single trait or even an upgrade of your troops. If you can't do that in the early rounds, well congratulations you'll be placed in the top 3 or worse top 4 of the match and lose a lot of points. It is like Clash Royale is screwing your gameplay.",1,2026-02-02 09:04:02
"Sad to say I'll only be playing this game for merge tactics. I've chosen to not spend money on this game years ago and it shows how much it means to win by paying. There is also much too going on: evolutions, hero abilities, multiple evolutions spots for higher levels. if you aren't paying you aren't winning. Such a sad state for the game from what it once was and yet supercell takes pride in this game. Good way to waste money though, it will never be the same",1,2026-01-30 13:36:25
"Played Clash Royale for 9+ years. It was worth the years spent grinding and the amount of money spent to supplement grinding to enhance my experience because the game used to be that epic. It is no longer epic. I spend way less time on the game now, no money, and am way less passionate about it than I once was because greedy Supercell can't listen to it's loyal and involved community. With every cash grab the game gets worse and more and more long time players are leaving. Horribly disappointed!",1,2026-01-30 01:19:51
"This game is so fun and stressful and stress relieving at the same time. But two things. 1, if you're a free to play kind of guy, and you make it to arena 8 or 9, you start noticing pay to wins, still fun though, until the pay to wins become overwhelming. 2, Heros are annoying, once they drop a bunch of evos like Mega Knight, Wizard, and Witch. It's kind of hard to counter. But I like the art and how you have to collect cards to level up, many cards to choose from, and much modes to choose from.",3,2026-01-05 02:37:03
"A good game, but genuinely unplayable half the time. It says my connection is bad, does the icon thing, freezes my game so it forces me to lose the match, and magically fixes itself randomly. I do what the support thing says, and it gets even worse. My connection doesn't even seem to be the actual issue because I've played in multiple locations, connected to different types of internet. I really like the game, but I'm rage quitting often because it is just straight up is forcing me to lose.",2,2026-01-30 23:16:15
"This game doesn't respect your time or money. This is a PVP game that uses progression as a form of leveling up your battling minions. the level up is RNG. You can either grind for the levels, or you can pay to have them faster. This wouldn't be an issue if the developers didn't raise the max level every time. Because they keep moving the goal post, all your grinding/money spent (aka accomplishment) is nullified until you do it again. The dev will keep dangling the carrot in front of you forever",1,2026-02-01 15:29:27
"last 2 updates have degraded the gaming experience. you have been steadily whittling away at what was once a great game. I've been playing since the beginning but I'm enjoying it less and less with each new update. the pay to win aspect has increased with each update and decisions like level 16, removing 2v2 and the old shop and the whole heros thing have almost pushed me far enough to stop playing altogether",3,2026-01-29 22:36:56
"This game makes no sense, every time I login 1 minute later I'm in a battle and it says connection error, it's the worst thing I have ever experience in life. And the pay to win in this game makes it so hard to play when your not a kid spending money that's not yours, I played years back when heroes and evos wasn't a thing and it was fun and way more addictive, I get off every 1 to 2 games that I play bc of how crazily the game changed.",1,2026-02-05 05:50:00
"This game used to be nice and fun to play, now it's become Pay to Win BS. The Game will either pair you with an opponent that has the exact counter to your deck or you'll be paired against an opponent that spent all their money on leveling up their cards to the max level that easily pushes through all your cards. It's no longer about skill but about who spent more money in this game to win. Pathetic.",1,2026-02-15 09:06:06
"Ive been playing this game for a couple years now, and it gets consistently worse with every update. Sometimes there are good things, but on balance, the game gets less and less playable, and more pay to win, with every update. Basic bugs don't get fixed for months while new features that cost money get added. I would say it's not worth investing your time or money in.",1,2026-02-08 07:09:04
Hogrider cycle. It's extremely rare to find someone not using it and it's nearly impossible to lose with. 40 win streak at max trophies just because of 1 card is ridiculous. I had to take him off to make the game half fun again but it would be nice to get an opponent that doesn't use him to change the game up a little. I'll raise my rating if he gets nerfed into oblivion for a few months at least.,1,2025-12-05 13:01:24
"Very dissapointing. I had a 5 star review from back when I played in 2022, things were very different. To keep it short, evos are an insane step up in power and the only way to get them was buying the battle pass or buy them from the shop ($12 each evo). Now the new hero class, which is arguably as broken if not more, introduces an even larger gap. They removed chests that could be bought with gems, they removed collectibles that helped level up cards. In summary, very greedy tactics. DONT PLAY!",1,2025-11-28 05:28:47
"I decided to try clash royal after a long time ago. But it's still the pay to win game. Basically, if you don't have money to spend on gems or something else. You're going to lose every time. It's unfair in my eyes how someone can buy all of these chests. if you have money, this game is for you. if you try grinding, it's gonna take forever to get all the cards when someone can buy them in ten seconds. Supercell needs to fix their game. It's overwhelming expensive frustrating and pay to win",1,2025-12-12 00:02:38
"After 3 years of free to play and reaching 15k I've found that the company is a greedy mess that doesn't care about your experience on this game as long as it's squeezing money out of you. They've lied to us many times over. One such example was them saying they wouldn't add any more levels after level 15, but now they gave us level 16, and the game is so much worse. They had their second chance and they blew it. Don't waste your time with this game its not worth it",1,2025-12-22 04:39:18
"At the core of this game is a really fun idea about a strategic chess meets arena combat experience. Defeat your opponent in a battle of wits. But that core, that idea, has been covered in layers of grime. The developers do not listen to the community and blatantly implement new mechanics and cards for monetary gain. It is extremely hard for a FTP player to advance. Spending so much time grinding and upgrading your deck, only for someone to buy the new season pass and get broken cards.",2,2025-12-02 12:22:39
"I am so disappointed. This game was the best some years ago, it was pretty well balanced and there was not to spend money to win because you were able to get it all in events and chests. Now the game is basically pay to win. It's so hard to upgrade your cards without buying the royal pass and extra stuff. where is the fun if you literally have to pay to have good cards and win.😮",2,2026-01-08 13:39:48

I come back after like 5 years on a brand new account and it was actually kind of fun. that was me exactly last September. literally in a span of a few months, they manage to add, quite possibly, the worst thing they could've to the game: heroes. they're just not fun, man. Heroes are entire win-checks. Oh, and to top it all off? Money hungry. I decided to spend a little cash left over for fun, and now I regret even doing so because I just gave them what they want.",2,2025-12-28 15:25:16
"This game is good and bad! first the cards are good, the fact it's pay to win it's so unfair, especially the over levels instead of fixing it, this game decided to ignore and release all those pay to win offers, the shop is full of stuff you need to pay to get. next, I want to talk about level 16, it's even more horrible, the devs promised not to add it and they did, that means more paying and this will make the game even more unfair for free to plays.",2,2026-01-13 14:52:02
"Im gonna give this game credits for everything they did, its very good but the only thing I hate is the new update they made: level 16, heros and pay to win. why did they add heros, I mean like it wasn't what we were waiting for, what they could've done instead was to add new champions from time to time or to add two once a year. But I can't lie I still find it fun.",4,2026-02-07 22:22:06
"I decided to return to the game after a two year hiatus back in August and because the game has had a resurge in popularity. I don't have any problem with the addition of level 16 and heroes as they do serve as a counter balance towards evolutions. However that counter balance would show IF the rest of the game was designed to make it easier for F2Ps to obtain them, that is my main gripe, there is hardly any way for F2Ps to obtain these things.",5,2026-02-14 08:26:55

One could choose to advance arenas more quickly by paying or it could all the same be done without paying but we were equal.

I deleted this game cause its simply to hard to play against people that take shop offers.",2,2026-01-31 01:03:52
decent game but once you start to climb up to the higher arenas most of the players are far more ahead of you in terms of troop levels. it then feels like a pay to win game regarding the huge level gaps. as an f2p player this makes it extremely frustrating and really difficult to make any progress. hope they'll balance the game and make the game fun for all sorts of players.,1,2026-01-08 00:19:59

I have been a dedicated supporter of supercell since their early days, yet I have never experienced such gross monetization of any fan base as has been happening in the last year in this game. The progress I have continuously made over the last 9 years has completely halted due to the fact that I would have to spend R1000 just to get one broken card to max, only for it to be swept under the rug 2 months later. Disappointed AF",1,2026-02-10 20:53:56

Now Merge Tactics is unplayable because you can buy a passive ability 'echo sage' where one of your units one-shots any of the enemy's units, and later in the game one-shots half the enemy team every three seconds, and it's borderline unkillable due to its HP.

I was addicted to this game but because of supercell being thirsty for money, I have lost the old interest in this game. thanks supercell.",2,2026-02-02 23:43:14
"I have been playing this game and I will continue to do so but here's the truth: There is no way you added evolutions and then heroes with the same cards so if I spent a pretty penny for one card then after I have to decide whether to use it as an hero or evolution. this is absurd. Plus you made it clear that we are just numbers and money. No feedbacks are listened and this is a huge L for the community. Nowadays if you wanna win you have to pay, that's it. And level 16 was stupid af",1,2026-02-14 22:29:50
The best game ever made. The best the best the best. editing my review (2026) : the dev team don't care about the player base. they don't listen to us and release updates filled with greed. this game has so much potential but they wouldn't listen to any of our suggestions. no one asked for level 16 and no one asked for heroes. i give it one star now.,1,2026-02-13 16:48:48

It gets really tiring to play against the exact same cards over and over again, and it makes the game feel boring and predictable.

Used to be a very good fairly matched game but over the years it has become entirely pay to win game if you dont have money dont expect to get very far especially with evolutions as all of them are hidden behind a paywall unless a special event is active.

Game has went severely downhill in the last 4 months or so. Heroes especially are extremely bad for the game and have turned it into severe pay to win and extra confusion. lvl 16 as well is horrible. I've had a Max lvl 15 deck for 2 years before the lvl 16 update and I could barely get a single full lvl 16 deck after saving up max resources for YEARS. The only reason it's a 2 star and not one is because the game could still be a 5 star if it's fixed. As of now though don't waste your time on it.,2,2026-01-31 04:43:37

"The matchmaking is clearly designed to frustrate you into spending money.

I have played this game off and on for years. I have to rewrite this as this game had become an absolute joke. changed to pay to win and everyone uses the same 3 decks. why have a ton of different cards if they are the only ones used. there is no originality or strategy anymore. this game honestly blows hard when it used to be a great game that would kill time. now just a waste of time,1,2026-01-28 04:46:12

You can be playing for an hour uninterrupted without moving and suddenly 1 match will start fine and then lose service while letting you see the opponent attack.

There's a point where skill barely becomes what determines who wins, and you can play 10 games in a row facing over level players. Do recommend it as a fun game, play with friends, but if you're f2p, good luck facing pay to wins.",4,2025-12-25 03:05:38
extremely pay to win. you can't even really play the game until you have max level cards which they keep pushing back further and further. im at 10000 trophies and every(and I mean EVERY!!!) single deck i face is the same firecracker megaknight slop..Im heavily thinking of deleting its gotten really dull playing zero variety in deck build. so in a nutshell early game its fun but once you get to a certain level progression grinds to a halt and you see the same deck every game. BORING!!!!!!!!!!!,1,2026-01-19 10:18:02
yeah this game is such a money scam. impossible to keep up. and even if you pay to play and advance its no guarantee....extremely unbalanced. Truly better games out there.... Solo Leveling is a high recommendation if you like fun games. also a great anime. Also easy to grind and level up and easy to get great characters. play games that are fun and free. Don't line these peoples pockets. its not worth it.,1,2025-12-13 22:53:20
5 star game but is to laggy that I can't even play . the start of the game my opponent is getting damage on towers and there is nothing I can do about it. but the lag continues through the game. I place a zap on Skelton barrel. it let's the Skeltons do damage then the zap comes I am on Android but have a good phone never had issues. please fix,4,2026-02-12 07:57:32
"1/29/16 finally unistalled, trash game now, played this on and off since it came out, and the newest update trashed the game. honestly been bad since they introduced the evolutions, if you're not pay to win, you get curb stomped by the OP new abilities. the game is obnoxiously over filled with microtransactions, even on the homepage, have to scroll past a ton ads in the store to get to the stuff you can buy with the free ingame currency. not enough characters to cover all the bad changes.

"2026 Update:- previous issues have not been resolved. after recent updates, servers crash frequently. no support Updating my review after 1 year: still no improvement. the matching function of this game is very poor ... you would often engage with opponents with very high level cards or vice versa. The developers are turning out to be greedy. Like many other poor apps out there, showing annoying notifications to buy useless and expensive stuff. 2 years later, above issues are the same.",1,2026-01-29 19:10:09
good game no doubt put every little thing has to have an animation and everyone i play against seems to have bought evolutions the p2w players dominate and because I don't wanna spend money on a mobile game I'm at a disadvantage CONSTANTLY. if your looking to pay for a game this is it if not don't download,2,2026-01-29 22:46:58
"Card Level Up Simulator by Scamcell A card level up game marketed as a real time strategy game. You'll always face over levelled opponents. And if you pay to get your cards maxed, you get scammed as they will add another level (which adds zero value to the game other than making both players have higher stat numbers), making existing levels easier to obtain, leaving you under levelled by one level. So, they effectively reduce your level by one TAKING BACK WHAT YOU ALREADY PAID FOR.",1,2025-11-27 21:51:07
"Deck mechanic leads to a weird game of chicken at the beginning of matches, where whoever blinks and plays first has disadvantage, while their opponent can counter. Additionally every round is the same board with little variation.",2,2026-02-08 08:10:15
This game is pretty fun but it makes me mad sometimes as a player who's been playing for a little over 3 months I've had a lot of fun. the only reason I don't give 5 stars is because it's so p2w I just got my first evo even after all the free evo events they need to make progression easier in my opinion because it was much easier when I first started other then that I haven't experienced any bug and it runs smoothly only if it wasn't as p2w I would give 5 stars,4,2026-01-24 09:42:00
"Base game is fine, I loved playing merge tactics until they added the echo sage, the card is extremely broken and overpowered making it just not enjoyable or the ""tactics"" they say it is.

"Everytime I have war attacks, supercell matches me up against people 2 or 3 king tower lvls higher than me! All of their cards are 2 or 3 lvls higher than me. It's not even fun!. Why couldn't something like war attacks be balanced, everyone be lvl 11 or something like that. It's like banging your head against a wall . Then randomly I'll get matched with someone 2 king towers lower than me and smash them. That isn't fun either!",1,2026-01-31 19:16:07
"The game is still fun but it's continuously spiralling down hill, it is extremely pay to win. I cannot win a game because I load onto one and they have full level 14 cards and im using lvl 9 because I don't feel like paying, which makes the game completely unfair.

"Edit: It's 2026 now and they've given up on evolutions and started doing heroic cards. The balancing is set just to get you to purchase the newest heroic every month. I'm done with this game. Oh and their pass is 12 dollars now. Terrible. The matchmaking isn't great, and you lose a lot of opportunity without the battle pass which costs 5 bucks a month/ 60 dollars a year, which is ridiculous considering it is a mobile game.",1,2026-01-26 06:30:07
The game is starting to get really buggy (I can't do any controls like uninstalling and playing). Overall a great game but it is a pay to win game now which is a negative but positives - which I am not going to go in detail about - overshadow all the negatives.,4,2026-01-31 00:55:10
"One of best game i played.. but i gave only 3 star because of this Ekko in Tactics match.. am sure its annoying for peoples who dont know how to counter that..and also its like enemy has one more character than you, also in one hit, he can wipe out your team🤣 Assassins ez counter this.. but we get bored for spamming assassin build",3,2026-02-07 18:47:47
"Sometimes there absolutely no point in playing. I have gotten do far that the towers are always stronger than my own . So that i am at a disadvantage even before battle . Then if i do fight, the opponent has higher level troops ? Where is the fairness in that ?! So after taking a beating usually about 3 to 4 times in a row the game let's you win again . A shame as the game characters are really good to play with .",2,2026-01-03 01:04:17
"This used to be a 5 star review from when the game was still new, but now this game has slowly but surely turned into pay to win slop.

These are annoying to impossible to get f2p and supercell is completely ignoring this and there are no signs of them making the f2p experience better anytime soon.",1,2026-02-05 22:04:42
"From my experience,all of the graphics are good and it is what you would expect for a 2025 game. Furthermore, there are no ads which makes playing experience for kids way more fu9n since there are absolutely NO inturuptions whatsoever. I hope you find this review very useful. Its intro too is fun and exciting. Its purpose is to teach kids strategies for other games like chess because of the countering in it. Personally, i think its purpose is very useful.",5,2025-12-20 21:56:49
"I used to love this game played since 2019, but ever since free to play players have been constantly pushed aside, it makes it hard for the remaining free to play players' stay when they constantly go against pay to wins. This game is only good if you have a maxed deck, which took me over a year to get as a casual player and even then you cant change anything unless its maxed and you can only use the same repetitive strategies. Once the free to play players leave,new players dont get in,then bye",1,2025-12-22 08:01:54
"I thought I would stick with this game through the thick and thin, but at this rate I'm going to uninstall it very soon. I feel the game is becoming too complicated for a casual player and it is no longer fun as if you're not playing a meta deck you paid 200 dollars to max out, it's impossible to get anywhere. If they revise the leveling system and remove heroes maybe I'll come back but I'm really not motivated to play anymore.",1,2025-12-29 01:11:09
"Its like a subscription based platform that's optional. each update they come with a new card that's broken and can only be accessible to pay to play characters. I have spent money on this game and stopped with the introduction of evo cards. Now, mainly playing free to play, they have added the new hero cards just emphasizing the situation. All of my books and magic cards are gone and they now have made it significantly harder to max out cards... I now believe I will never catch up.",1,2025-11-27 07:00:59

"This game used to be really fun, but with the implementation of the ""battle pass"" it has become more pay to win than ever. I've played this game since 2017 and slowly watched it go down the drain. At a certain arena, you will basically be cut off from progressing if you don't spend $ as the match making is as unbalanced as it gets. In the new update cards are now lvl 16 when lvl 15 was VERY hard to get The new hero card is also a no win condition to bait for pass purchases. where's my refund $$",1,2025-12-27 23:28:54
"They added level 16 and heroics. Basically all you need to hear. Not even saying anything about removal of books. No one asked for this, no one wanted it.

Extremely disappointed with the new update.",1,2025-11-25 23:16:09
"This game used to be very fun and I enjoyed having a friendly competition with my friends at school but things haven't been the same. The first fifteen arenas are chill but when you get to arena 19 or higher, then the game isn't fun anymore. I cannot progress at all. When you win one game, you gain about 27 or 30 trophies but when you lose, it sets you back either the same amount or higher. Supercell, make this game more balanced so it is easier to progress.

Now I need to empty my wallet to get anywhere as I keep coming up against players who have obviously spent a load of real money to upgrade their deck. I know the company is run as a business but now you are just being greedy, money grabbers, only interested in the profit, not the playing experience",1,2025-12-06 19:09:55
Game was fun but very predictable. When you get close to leveling up you lose about 5 matches to bring you back down. Compete against people more then double your castle level. Unevenly matched a lot! People that pay real money to play get the advantage. I played when it first came out & it was the same so I deleted it.. I downloaded it again & it never changed.

I wont be purchasing anymore passes in the future.",1,2025-12-12 05:24:46
"I really used to enjoy this game. Now it seems like the devs only try their hardest to milk more money from the player base. I think my personal favorite was ""we are only bumping max level to 15, it won't go any higher..."" and then to top it all off, after this most recent update they gave gems (in game currency) as compensation, but made it so you can only buy worthless and uninspired cosmetics.

I have been in the highest league in ranked before, as well as having been top 10k in merge tactics and the most recent update is the worst one I have ever seen.

Really frustrating to see the game get more pay to win",1,2025-11-24 21:02:40
"The game is fun, strategic and fast paced at first but is absolutely ruined by slow progression once you get to higher levels, essentially forcing you to spend money if you want to level up cards within a reasonable time frame or get into new arenas and unlock more cards. this game is free to play at first, but once you get to a certain level/arena it's just Pay to Play, which is a tragedy considering Clash Royale used to be one of the best mobile games ever",2,2025-12-04 17:23:44
"Actually might be one of the worst games now because they just decided to throw it away for money. I actually spent money to try to get cards to level 15 and what do you know, they make a level 16 and the money I spent went to nothing, I didn't even get back the items i bought and used to get to level 15. Now I'm in an area where there are just pay to win kids and there's no point in playing anymore. Honestly sad how a company will throw away their most popular game for money.

"This game has gotten too greedy with the p2w, it is becoming unplayable with the constant chest nerfs and adding levels. Not to mention every time an evo is brand new and only playable through a micro transaction, it is conveniently 'the strongest card in the game' for the rest of the season. Don't get me wrong, it is possible to win most matches, but the nature of the monetary system results in rarely finding a fair match.",2,2025-12-18 01:16:26
The game is generally lagging quite a lot on pc but the game is still bearable and is quite fun. I know many people who say the game is pay to win which I agree but there are measures to make sure that the game is completely pay to win for example there are events in the game giving you evolution shards. And with the most current update the game has never been more free to play allowing you to get cards without gambling with chests instead you could use gems which you get through many ways.,3,2025-11-27 21:35:27
Great game but they got rid of all skill. once they added evolutions they ruined the game and I stopped playing. No more skill or grind to play the game. Keep in mind I have been playing for 10 years now. That completely ruined it for me and my friends and we all have basically maxed accounts. With this we will never play again. They just are money hungry. Pay to win. (Now added champions that really took skill out $20 can win you any game now I stopped playing every supercell game money hungry),1,2026-01-02 00:48:13

It has been fun for years but the recent changes seem to be motivated by money. I Understand these products are made for profit but the price hikes and now harvesting player data for ads and for whatever reason the game suddenly requires cookies after running fine for ages without it. It went from Free-to-play friendly to down right pay-to-win. Disgusted with the latest changes and the constant moving of the goal post. Takes ages to max out a card and then they increase the max stats.,1,2025-11-25 00:29:58
"Bots are being changed to be less distinguishable from actual players every update. There is no reason to this, other than to make it easier to hide when they give the player free wins after loss streaks (if you stay below a certain win% for long enough you will be put in a bot queue indefinitely), and make matchmaking more opaque.

As an intermediate player, I already get the jist of all of the cards and gameplay with rewards. The game rapidly gets too competitive and has literally been designed to enrage us. Even the latest music is more aggro.",3,2026-01-02 15:31:06
Stopped playing the game when they decided that every evolution needs to be broken and have some way of countering every deck. Not to mention the monetization is just predatory.

"It's fun for a bit, but after a handful of hours of play it will begin to constantly match you vs players that are way above your level in what appears to be a blatant attempt to manipulate you to pay to win (their primary way of making $). The grind becomes nearly unbearable, especially w. no concede button. It's a bummer they sold out to greed rather than make this a pure skill game, cuz the core game is pretty fun. But no matter how much skill you have, the bad design rewards unit level more.",2,2025-11-30 15:31:24
"Progression is now slower than ever due to recent nerfs. Even if you buy the battle pass ($13), it doesn't provide a meaningful amount of resources. Maxing out a deck now takes either ~1 year of grinding, or $100. I've only given 2 stars because there are still game modes where all cards are set to the same level, which equalizes the playing field.",2,2025-12-05 04:07:41
"I played the game from the beginning. I haven't played for awhile, I came back cause of nostalgia and it was completely different. it became so pay to win. I miss the old clash where rare was rare and legendary was legendary, now you can buy everything ingredients the first arena lost a player here can't play with this going on",1,2025-12-01 15:37:46
the game is very good but the only concern is that this game is stuck at 97% loading ... I tried restarting the device and the game by reinstalling it but it is still stuck ... I cleared the cache and my wifi connection is also perfect ... I dont know what happened and I eventually quit the game and when I tried to open it after 1 year or something the problem is same....,2,2025-12-10 11:04:46
"I played this Game for over 6 years playing thousands of battles. Free to play. Over time this game became more and more pay to play adding level 14, 15, and now 16 adding broken evos that would then get nerfed to the ground the next month wasting all the time and energy needed to get it. Now they added Heros which is not just a lazy gimmick that wasn't implemented well but just adds more difficulty to gathering cards and gimmicks needed to build the deck that you want to play.",1,2026-01-13 09:28:53
"Never left a review for anything before, but had to for this new update. It really shows how you care for your player base with all these new updates coming out. Thanks a lot supercell. Edit: I hate this game even more. I cant even get to ranked where theres at least a lvl 15 cap on cards cause I face a 2-3 lvl difference at 10k. At least let ranked be open to more people so I can play at an even playing field and people can actually beat me with skill.",1,2025-12-20 09:51:16
"Do not play this game if you aren't prepared to pay at least 20$ a month.This game is not free to play friendly and requires a substantial time investment to play competitively.

"not worth your time. I've been playing this for years and was okay with a good chunk of the changes over the years, but now all my books were converted to 20% of the8r actual value. Was it too difficult to let us use them on the level 16 update? the pass has been losing value over time and everything including the loot box's value has gone down with every change done to the game. give your time and money to a company that really does listen to you instead of their shareholders",1,2025-11-25 03:14:18
"Been playing for years, 15k trophies, made it very far in the game, but they've finally ruined it with the recent updates. Way too many overpowered cards that aren't fair to like 90% of the rest of the cards. Getting your king 3 shot by a level 22 minipekka that kills 7 level 15 cards beforehand just gets so boring. The game is very boring unless you pay to max all your cards and buy the newest stuff asap. Don't waste your time if you haven't played before.",2,2025-12-04 13:29:29
"Fun but encouraged to pay to win. I've played for about 4 months and it's very fun. Personally I have never spent a dime on the game but I still have lots of good items. If you want to have lots of good loot without paying, you'll have to grind the special events and battle pass a bit. But luckily they're pretty frequent. As I'm writing this, in a day, they'll have and event where you can get a free evolution which, for those who don't know, are highly valued. All together, very fun and unique.",4,2025-12-21 05:28:28
A year ago it was possible to get to the top totally free to play (went to 10k wich was the maximum without spending a single dime) but it is not possible anymore as they removed almost every way to get free stuff and blocked behind a paywall the new additions wich are RIDICULOUSLY broken. They DON'T CARE about their playerbase. My note before that was 4/5 but is now the minimum. The only good points are the very low data usage and they don't use AI but that's all.,1,2025-12-19 21:26:40
"This game uses bots and complex algorithms to make sure you always win after a losing streak, and lose after a winning streak no matter what. The algorithm scans your deck to see which cards you're playing, then if you've been losing it generates a bot with bad counters for your deck or the bot's deck gives your deck so much value. (If you have goblin curse, the bot will have swarm cards). If you've been winning vice versa. It's also very pay to win. Basically, the game is a casino on your phone",1,2025-12-13 16:00:58
"I don't know if I've ever seen a game become so bad over time with a company that acts like it hates its players. I've been playing on and off for 9 years and they've finally put me off to it. Don't bother getting into this game unless you want to spend hundreds of dollars to even have a chance at competing. Unbelievably pay to win, and the new hero cards and level 16 throw any sense of balancing out the window in an attempt to get even more money from you. Used to be a good game",1,2025-12-18 23:46:38
This game is such a cash grab and unless you are willing to spend money you won't really have fun. even if you spend a few bucks here and there and spend time upgrading cards they will eventually release new cards that you will need to spend money to get access too. these cards are insanely over powered and basically eliminates any possibility of free to play players being able to win. This game is becoming like pixel gun 3d. Just with more of a playerbase,1,2025-12-24 12:07:00
"If you have money, you can easily beat this game. And supercell makes it worse every update. There is NO tactic or strategy for at least mid to late-game if you are willing to spend money and free to play is almost impossible unless you play for a very long time.

(2025)update! game is still definitely unbalanced even 10 years later. Fun to play for a bit but after awhile it's the same as any other game. The play to win features are still OP THIS IS A PAY TO WIN GAME. (2016)But 3 hours 8 hours 12 hours to open chest. Is waaaaay. To long. That coupled with on a 4 chest que only let's you play 2-3 times a day. UNLESS you buy gems constantly to instantly finish the chest. This is a FOR PROFIT GAME 100%.,1,2025-12-26 20:45:52

"I loved this game once. The gameplay was really fun and the base is still a great game, but greedy supercell monetized the game to another level. When you mention Pay 2 win I'll think of this game first. It's not even funny. Skill isn't needed to climb the ladder. A piece of advice: don't spend a single cent on this game and don't break your phone out of rage. Remember that THIS is a BAD game. may the force be with us",1,2025-12-11 05:38:49
"this game is absolutely horrendous for one's mental health, it has never been properly balanced, it is incredibly pay to win, repetitive and I cannot think of a single time this has ever been fun. The game only is surviving off hype from big creators and its addictive nature. if I could give it a zero I could, though that still may be giving this too much credit. So put plainly this game is not good, you will usually, if not always, lose to the person who has more money in the bank. Do not play.",1,2025-12-01 12:00:49
"game is genuinely fun but unfortunately riddled with the NEED (yes need) to make in-app purchases, whilst giving the idea that it is free-to-play. Before heroes this was manageable, but leaving these clearly game-winning cards behind a paywall, + increasing the level cap once more, + removing alternate forms of progression to ensure in app purchases is just evil. Just make it a premium game and tone down the free slop. You're shooting yourselves in the foot",2,2026-01-16 17:25:24
ok I like the game but new stuff like merge tactics is bs. I win 4 times in a row and in 2 matches I'm out while other people I've beat are losing more often and still in it. if you play the game you will understand what I mean. there is no way to contact supercell to show instances for corrections. I used to buy the pass but not worth it. this is pay to win fully. if I could give 0 stars I would. only reason I play is so I can play with my son,1,2026-01-11 14:39:19
"Why is the Pass $12! it should be $5 max! So much more people would buy it! For some reason I spent so much money on the game but I'm not buying passes unless their $6 or less!

I will admit I left the game for 8 years because I'm not waiting to open one chest at a time! thankfully chests are instant now!",2,2025-12-18 06:01:19
A very fun and addicting game for a while. But if you're free to play don't bother. The game was the best that I've ever played it as in the last few months (I've been playing for four years) but then supercell decides to add broken heroes that are very hard to get for free and level 16. All supercell cares about is money. Would not recommend it for people that want to progress as free to play.,3,2025-12-31 23:13:55
"I dislike that they have added level 16 into the game. My main issue is that they locked Ranked mode which is capped at level 15 is locked behind ladder which has all level 16s. This means 3 shoting goblins, lava pups, and log doesn't kill dart goblin. Many of these crucial interactions makes the game depressing instead of fun since it is pay to win instead of skill. I'm a solid player (~65% win rate), but the level gap has me about 50-50 now.",1,2025-12-04 01:38:19
"I usually never leave a review but it is unbelievable how the devs can make the game so bad. In the last update where they added heroics and level 16 everything became so much more pay to win. I have been playing for 6 years as a free to play and got to 10000 trophies recently. But the game is not fun, every game I face against people with the musketeer hero knight with everything 2 level higher than I have. The devs don't care about the players they just want to make more money. Don't reccomend",1,2025-12-13 03:39:21
"I 1-star'd this game back in 2018, but thought I'd come update my review. came back to play it this year because one of my friends mentioned they had a new game mode. In the few months I've been in, I've seen how egregiously pay-to-win the normal game mode is, and the devs are leaning more into it now. Raised max level (again) and just being as anti-consumer with every change as possible. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",1,2025-12-07 22:02:08
"As a f2p player. i can confirm that it is nearly impossible to progress without money. every update this game adds makes it feel like they wanted us to give up. ive spent most of my days grinding and yet i still cant progress.

Silencing creators is not nice. Forcing professional platers into paying for in-game items in order to have a levelled playing field with other top players is not cool. Forcing high-level players into purchasing in-game items in order to keep up with other high-level players is not cool.

I now not even able to load the support in app. So I've emailed them and they said to message them in game which I can't.

Now they changed the lvling system back to the original way and added a new level. I Quit playing because they made it so hard to level up and now I need to gain two levels to be max lvl again.

Clan wars suck too. just going against cards and towers 3-4 levels higher on average than my highest every game. no balance",1,2026-01-04 03:28:53

Additionally, the progression has become terrible, you can rarely upgrade the cards you want to upgrade, and with the removal of books, it just gets worse. Good game, progressively downgrading.",1,2025-12-29 05:23:33
It was fun ay first but as you progress u just meet enemies with high levels. Especially in the right ranks. Game is unplayable with other players having more levels than you . Note to all new f2p players just uninstall the game. Because it's going to be frustrating getting beaten by a higher level deck and to addition on level 16 it made the game even more unplayable thanks to clash Royale,1,2025-11-30 12:34:39
The game is HEAVILY fixed. Very easy to lose 10+ in a row because the game doesn't register that u are putting units down which can leave a big delay in putting units down. Worth a look and still fun to play but you will never win many in a row. often have team mates quit in 2v2 as well.

Extremely pay to win. The main game mode is not catered towards people who don't want to spend money. At 7.9k trophies I'm facing people with an average level of one/two higher than my own cards.

"After 9 years of playing this game (got into it about 6 months after launch) It was incredibly difficult to watch the game fall from where it started. The developers have gone from inspired to money motivated easily tilting their one of a kind game for a quick buck.

"Clash Royale has become more pay to win in recent years. It's a brilliant game but money can buy you too much of an advantage. I have hit ultimate champion and have enjoyed the game as a free to play player, but recently pay to win has made it much harder to progress. The game now requires consistent grinding and even then it's quite hard to level up your cards to the max level. Not to mention the evolutions and heroes that you have to pay for as well. It's a great game but also a bit pay to win",4,2025-12-26 04:28:14
The game itself is awesome. But the problem is that the system pairs you with players who buy with money and as a f2p player you are cocked. It's just not fair for you to play as a f2p player with 12 level towers and 12 level cards to get paired with someone with 15 towers and cards. So if the pairing system is kind of fixed with this issue then it would be very helpful. So it would be better if you get paired with someone with your level cards and towers. The game is pay to win.,1,2026-01-10 20:05:16
This game is strictly pay to win with the recent changes. Also their new way to keep you down in the rankings is for you to suddenly have connectivity issues. This only happens when you are playing meaningful (Trophy Road) games causing you to lose those trophies. For your mental health and well-being don't even download this game.,2,2025-12-15 23:47:29
This game is actually really fun at the beginning until you realize it's a full-on cash grab without any sort of campaign mode. the first experience I had was getting into a clan that booted me for not going to some weird infinite gem website. and then I kept playing and realized that there's actual buyable consumables that make your cards stronger. literally pay to win. you'll notice it later when you get to people who just like threw out three or four combos of whatever and spam emotes,1,2025-12-25 17:52:59

"it is absolutely NOT a free to play game.. just fyi, you will never be anywhere even close to finishing the game no matter how dedicated you are, unless you pay up you will never actually be able to play competitively.

The game at its Prime when it was launched was SUPER FUN and not P2W at all but as Time Passed, GREEDYCELL or ZEROBRAINCELL started becoming MORE and MORE Greedy after each UPDATE.

biggest Pay to play game in app store.

I keep having the same problem frequently where when connected to wifi the game drops out and I lose connection. This is particularly frustrating as it usually happens mid-game. I have no such issue with ANY other app or game and all other devices stay connected so I know it is not WiFi and my phone is relatively new. it also never happens on mobile data. please fix!,1,2026-01-04 15:19:52
"I cannot recommend this game in its current state. It has become heavily pay-to-win. The developers frequently release 'evolutions' that are overpowered, wait for players to spend money on them, and then nerf them into the ground shortly after to force you to buy the next thing. It’s a frustrating cycle that makes the game more stressful than fun. Save your time and your money",1,2026-01-02 14:41:23
I have played in this game for about 4 years and I could say now that the game has to remove or change options to pay money. There is the shop where you could buy some updates or new cards for your deck for games coins but you also have the option to pay money or just buy a pass royal. And in my opinion this is terrible because you could play in this game for all your life but your deck and your cards will be weaker than some guy who just started playing but he spent money in this game.,1,2026-01-05 22:08:08
"the game is fun for a while then you will reach a point where most games are unfair as one player (usually the opponent) is a higher level but this doesnt mean it is impossible to get to a higher arena, it simply makes ir harder and less fun as you will lose and a satisfying win streak is almost impossible, after you get to a high trophy count only then can you play on a even playing field",2,2025-12-15 12:29:27
"the newest update was one of the worst things this game has ever done. ive been playing for 9 years, ive seen everything with this game. introduction to champions, evolutions, level 15 has all made this game impossible to play as a free to play player. ive put good money just to compete but now after this horrible update i have to pay more, losing all my wild cards i had been saving for years and giving me gems? on top of that welcome to another step of bs with level 16. Im done with this game.",1,2025-11-25 14:45:54
"The levelling system throws all strategy out of the window, Champion and evolution cards are a really great concept, but they're way out of reach for casual players. It's not terrible, but I wouldn't recommend it either. 16/12/25 Edit: Lowering it to one star. They will push updates against the players' wishes that have no effects on gameplay and only serves as an excuse to enlarge the gap to reach a MAX level.

"The Game overall would be flawless, I actually liked the concept of evolutions at first. Not for long tho cause the game started to make it harder and harder 4 free 2 play players (missimg Seasonshop worse chest, lucky drops etc.) The developers are basically breaking their fingers just so they can spit pit more unbalanced troops, evos, towers and levels.

I've held a 5 star review on this game since I was in middle school. I am now a college graduate updating my review to a 1 star. The dev team is not listening to the community at all and punishing those who seek to play this game for free or just for fun. Constantly raising prices for anything while creating new levels out of thin air to make people purchase more while also removing any rewards from non-comp game modes. I have had to upgrad my deck to max level 5 times now. Gross incompetence.,1,2025-11-24 19:45:36
"I've always enjoyed this game ever since it launched initially. However, recent choices with their updates make it clear what direction they are taking with this game. New champion cards on top of evolution and another level all in one update and a gem system that is outrageously poor. Strictly pay2win. Cause even with any freebies they provide, the players will have to continue chasing the new champions that release and further spend or grind even harder to keep up. Supercell, do better.",1,2025-11-26 08:27:58
"Spend 9 years playing the game, hit max level now Supercell decides to raise the cap. leaving all the work put into getting to max to end up meaning nothing. let's not forget though, if you spend money you can hit max again in no time :). all they want is to suck as much money out of your pockets as they can. Don't bother wasting your time, the best days of this game are long gone and are not coming back.",1,2025-11-24 23:15:38
"The game is fun. However, there are far too many cards to collect. They did not scale the card collecting, as new cards were added, effectively. You will hit a wall around lvl 9/16. Be ready to grind for another year or two, if you want to try to max your cards. Would not recommend playing the game until they fix card acquisitions from lvl 9 - lvl 16.",1,2025-12-29 13:58:23
"This game is incredibly frustrating to play as you can have the highest level troops you want, but if you don't pay to get the evolutions for your troops, you will continuously lose. The evolution aspect of this game is complete rubbish edit: They have now added an obscene amount of evolutions that are broken and never patched.

"TL;DR: Nice game, but you have to spend real money so you could play against players that are same level as you.---A qualitative game and very nice and sometimes relaxing, sometimes competitive enough.---Animations are very nice, the quality also.---But in most cases matches are „rigged” somehow (the trophy road and clan wars) as they put you in the same match with players with high card levels.

This game may be free to play but surely it isn't free to win. It's for those Credit Card warriors. It will take you years to max out a single card. not to mention the 100+ cards.

Also how can I get matched with a person who has a lot less trophies than me but get destroyed by them which makes no sense and I shouldn't be losing that.

i used to play this game years ago .. i reinstalled it and boom i was surprised by the unfair game it has become and you are kind of forced to pay money to stay on the trophy track with the new mods.. unfortunately i'm going to quit the game again.. waste of time for me.,1,2026-02-08 21:16:51
Dont bother downloading if you dont intend on spending money because you will lose most of the time pay to win period. as the game starts opposite player drops over 20 value worth of troops while you struggle to deploy and wait for your value to increase. idk if they're hacking or pay to win cuz I did the maths and there's no way they can deploy that many troops in a short amount of time.,1,2025-12-08 00:14:16
"BOTS... SO MANY BOTS... I came back to the game like 2 months ago, and I gained like 3000 trophies from where I was placed during my few year break. MORE THAN 80% OF MATCHES WERE BOTS!! They always use a handful of messages/emotes only at the end or beginning of the match, it gets very obvious really fast cause its super consistent between matches. And some say they're in clans, but you check the battle logs and magically they're clanless the next second... Used to like this game but, wow.",1,2025-12-12 06:24:26
"ive never played a game that caters to pay to wins more than this game. the only way to ""get better"" at this game is to splurge all of your money to this game. it also doesnt help at all that supercell ONLY cares about money and not the players enjoyment. the amount of advertisements to buy something, this recent update which ONLY CATERS TO PAY TO WINS, and the new ""heroic"" rarity. this game has so much potential. it just needs better matchmaking and LESS ADVERTISEMENTS TO BUY OVERPOWERED CARDS.",1,2025-11-25 12:57:25
"Your game is so paid to win now. The introduction of Heros just proved that. Ever since the Evo cards coming into the game, everyone in ranked ladder maxes out their funds to bankruptcy just to max level everything. I miss the old Clash Royale where it wasn't a constant 5th job to level up cards and grind ranked ladder. I've played for 8 years and have a single level 16 (Maxed before Heros) card. A SINGLE ONE. Everyone I face now has full maxed out deck essentially, all 16. Not Fun. All paid.",2,2026-02-13 06:20:31
Great game. Unfortunately it's too ptw. Hit a low point when Supercell removed book of books and added heroes. A company that just wants as much money as possible and doesn't listen to the community. It's a shame because it it an amazing game otherwise,2,2026-02-09 13:57:34
"The game is very fun and addictive until you reach 5000 trophies in which you get bombarded with pay to win players , hard counters , megaknight users and more don't bother wasting weeks of your life just to have supercell put you against someone who has the exact counter to everything you have. If you are gonna play this make sure you have more then 50 bucks in account if you wanna progress",2,2026-01-03 18:59:03

"Clash Royale is a perfect example of how to ruin a great game. What started as a skill-based strategy title is now a pay-to-win grind where card levels and evolutions matter more than skill. Matchmaking is unfair, updates add greed instead of balance, and progression is designed to frustrate you into spending money. There’s still a good game underneath, but it’s buried under monetization and bad design choices.",1,2025-12-27 01:13:47
"clash royale is a good game ,but there is two reasons 1 pay to win like if don't want to pay anything it pops up telling do you want to buy this starter pack 2 reason the i was a begginer i liked the map at first ,but everything changed on Thursday the map changed this was the worst map ever there is only one tower now and the card they gave us this is the only cards we can use .",2,2026-01-17 12:52:52
"Don't play this game if you value your time and money. On a more serious note, this is one of the best mobile games I've played in terms of gameplay, but it is also one of the most predatory.

"game isn't worth it unless you pay to play. on top of that, they added evolutions and champions which makes it harder to win unless you pay to have cards that strong. oh and they will constantly put you up against plays of higher levels with stronger cards. all in all, its not worth the time. Im a level 12 fighting level 15s.",1,2026-01-22 06:05:52
great game *update* (changed from 5 to 4 stars) slowly dying in the worst way 😭. the heroes kinda defeat the purpose of the game otherwise alot more people would still play. everyone I know has decreased their playtime on clash ever since the royal hogs Evo has ended. the hero ice golem doesn't do anything and no one in their right mind is buying it for 15 bucks it's a scam.,4,2026-01-25 04:25:31
"Supercell, I am so disappointed... you managed to kill the love I had for this game. I've played your game since it came out, and I enjoyed it. I've spent countless hours and a lot of money because I genuinely loved this game, but this update made it unplayable. I was close to finally maxing out my cards, opening new possibilities for new decks, but now I'm stuck with the same 8 cards. And let's not even mention the heroes. I am so done with this game. After almost 10 years. Thank you Supercell",2,2025-12-05 09:17:40
"The gameplay itself is incredible and addictive, but unfortunately the game balance is lacking and monetization is very predatory. While it's still fun to play from time to time, this can no longer be called a strategy game.",3,2026-01-24 01:41:43
"The new levels, champions and lack of soild FTP options has made the game less fun over the years. we used to be able to play the game relatively free, but the past year or two has made it incredibly hard to. the chest removal for lucky drops also is not friendly to new players as well, getting multiple different cards and gold for leveling makes more sense than getting a burst of a card that you may not even use. there also needs to be a consistent way of getting Evos as well, theres too many",1,2025-11-26 01:18:03
This game is fun at first but becomes pay to win way to fast. The cancelation button doesn't even work. How am I supposed to go against a level 15 player being level 12. This game needs some hard balancing. The HORABLE level 16 update and heros was the last straw. Games should not be this mo ey hungry. It's time to move on since this game It digging its own grave.,1,2026-02-08 11:29:53
"The game balance is horrendous. I am convinced the developers do not play the game at all. That, along with micro transaction temptations thrown in your face every time you log in it is obviously a pay to win game. I am mostly a free to play player and keeping up with leveling and the changing meta that after a season, they nerf to the ground is near impossible for casual players. awful and disgraceful for supercell executives and developers.",1,2026-01-21 01:57:04
"The game has strayed off of its path much too far. The steady and consistent gameplay you were looking for has now been replaced with P2W and anguish. These ""Heroes"" they've added is proof of concept. All they want is money now, and you can't get to the top without it..",1,2025-11-25 05:06:51
"I had to update my rating. recent changes to the game have added flashing lights and a spinning chest to EVERY reward.

"I haven't played the game ever since Heroes were added to the game (Heroes, NOT Champions). Heroes are a fundamentally unfair and unbalanced feature that is mostly locked behind a pay wall. Despite the backlash the devs never fail to be as stubborn as possible. I am only returning to the game if Heroes are moved or isolated into a specific gamemode",1,2026-01-25 07:35:28
the game is programed to cheat. characters will target stuff that further away and characters that target buildings will target buildings that are further away. the best part is that this company dose not care and have been making that game cheat more overtime. now the game will change your character you chose and not place them where you tild them to on the map.,1,2025-11-28 22:56:03
"Evos arent balanced, but it's still a good game so far. don't burn out on trophy road, lots of other modes to play. EDIT: new update killed f2p 1v1s & 2v2s, which are the unranked modes(fun, mostly balanced matches). It's a good time to take a break and see if they fix the game they just broke. New players stay away unless you're hooking up a healthy credit card",1,2025-11-25 10:19:25
"Clash Royale was always a bit pay-to-win, but this update takes it too far. Progression is super slow unless you spend money. They removed books and the old point-earning area, which really hurts free-to-play players. Now everything pushes you toward buying bundles or passes. They ignored real balance issues and focused on monetization. The game just isn’t fun in its current state. and never was they just made it worse",1,2025-12-03 09:36:14
"I've been playing clash royale for 3 years, but for the last 1 or 1.5 years, everything has become about money. If you have money, you can win and level up your cards.

"The concept of the game is fun, yes, the execution is terrible. What used to be a fun game has, in the past few years, turned into a terrible pay to win game. Supercell, being the greedy company they are, of course make it so that if you're a free to play player, the progression takes years, and after a certain point is just plainly impossible without the need to spend money. They're removing free ways to progress, and making it so you have to pay. And they don't nerf OP pay to win cards.",1,2025-08-24 03:45:30
"turned pay to win. doesn't even pay off to be a no lifer for the game cuz the second its off the sale it gets nerfed. so even if you get the new stuff and use it your strategy sinks as soon as the pay to win time is done. dont get me wrong, i love it and played for many years. it is just slowly turning into a p2w.",1,2026-02-06 19:24:18
"One star. Have come back many times to make sure it stays one. I can go for day, weeks, months, you name it, without getting angry, mad, or even frustrated. once.

This game is addicting, toxic, and ultimately unhealthy. I'm done.",1,2025-11-24 07:59:52
"this stupid game. guys I highly recommend not getting it. it's really easy in the low arenas, but as you climb higher it gets was harder. I haven't won a game in 7 games in arena 22, because my opponents had level 16 stuff and level 15 king tower, they just pay to win, this is not fair at all. it isn't even a skill issue anymore it's just pay to win, really annoying game!",1,2025-12-16 05:01:00

"This company is single handedly the greediest company ever created. They destroyed the game by introducing unnecessary updates, Yeah, I'm talking about lvl 16. Level 16 is such a cheap way to extort money, it doesn't add anything new to the game, only increasing the damage and hp. These horrible updates have absolutely killed the free-to-play player base. Never trust this greedy company.",1,2026-02-11 02:20:37
New update is killing the game and actively making it harder for free to play players. I had all my cards level 14 but now they are being outleveled by level 15 and 16 cards. I have responsibilities and a life so I cant be bothered to play spend money on this game to keep up with all the pay to win players. the new hero's are also extremely pay to win as you can have 2 in your deck but only at a high enough level.,2,2025-12-02 00:18:14
"the new update removed a core item from the game the books of cards and ""compensated"" players who lost their collection of these items. the compensation was wildly inadequate and infuriating for those of us that lost extremely hard to obtain items ie the book of books and got a handful of gems in return.. that item was worth significantly more than what was given in compensation and feel like the devs just took away from players in an attempt to force in game purchases to make up for their loss",1,2025-11-24 22:47:16
"This game is entirely pay to win. I used to love playing this game until the money sucking developers added evos you can buy and level 16. It used to be fun, now its really just a game of how deep your wallet is. All the developers want is your money, they don't care if you have fun or not, at the end of the day they just want to suck you dry of all your money. Please don't download this game and if you do, don't give them any money.",1,2025-12-15 12:25:16
I have loved this game since I started. I'd play nonstop with my friends coaching me while I played. But I got more and more experience with the game and noticed pay to win EVERYWHERE. Now this game isn't the same ever since those broken evos and heroes came out. Cards that need proper balancing have been ignored for a while. I can't stand this game anymore.,2,2026-01-19 15:14:00
This is a great game that is pretty easy to learn it can be challenging at times to rank up but it is all worth it in the end when you finally get to that next arena. My only complaint is that this game can be extremely pay to win and if you get put against someone with a hard counter or your deck then you are instantly fried and there is no way you are winning that. But overall this is a wonderful game that I highly recomend,5,2026-01-18 08:46:09
"this game was one of the best mobile games ever known to Man but now... its the most money hungry game, the game was already bad why did yall Release heroes it made the game even worse. and the game is so unbalanced, it dosen't matter what level you are, you are GOING to go against a maxed out enemy its just unfair. fix your game or you'd see it die infront of your face its absolutly suprising what you have became",1,2026-02-10 22:58:46
"this game was gifted it was a great game, I say was because it used to be good. Then the game got played by streamers clash had one job and they blew it. they are money seeking freaks and this game is not worth playing anymore.

"Absolutely unplayable, I have been playing this game for many years and lately it is just unplayable. I have been pushing past 13900 trophies and supercell decided to reset me at 10000 trophies without any compensation.

"Honestly, I have a lot to say, the games good, but why do they get an advantage if they are winning, I should get one so its fair. Or no one gets a dis or advantage when they kill a tower, also, this game makes no sense. I shouldn't play people with 2 to 3 levels higher cards, also we shouldn't make you pay for everything. Make stuff easier to get a the most. But, please don't make anything avoid the pekka, and nerf it. Make stuff easier to level up. I hope you read this. But you won't.",2,2026-01-19 01:28:12

Way too pay to win they introduced hero's and along with its supposed to gjve us a easier way of unlocking hero and evolution cards by collecting 200 fragments from boxes. This wouldn't be so bad if the boxes didn't only give 1-2 most the time fragments per box which they've only given us 6 boxes so far which you would need to open almost 200 for 1 version of 1 character,1,2026-01-08 16:11:38

Do not recommend getting the game if you've never played your supporting a greedy cash grabbing company that dosent support the meta or fan base. Every update the game gets worse I spent 3 years free to play and got a bunch of my cards leveled up but now everything's in the drain because of level 16. Its even harder for lower levels because being free to play is so hard now to level up cards especially without the event shop.

I genuinely close the game whenever I see one. This game is so pay to win. Time and time again, this company has nerfed progression, so they can upcharge $15 new broken cards. I can barely bring myself to play anymore. It is comical how childishly grummy this company is. The players are speaking by simply logging off.",1,2025-12-18 13:56:51
This game used to be a fun strategy game but they've ruined it with new mechanics that make it more of a button mashing arcade game. A few select overpowered heroes and evolution cards have made gameplay repetitive because everyone uses a small subset of the many cards available.

I've seen all the ups and downs of this game and grinding through the awful progression that is Clash Royale, and realistically if SuperCell doesn't chill out with these constant nerfs to progression and introductions of more pay to win mechanics, then it's really going to screw over the general playerbase as a whole, and turn away new players as well.",1,2026-01-03 04:17:20
"The arenas feel fine, but Clan Tournaments are a disaster. I'm tower level 12, most of my units are between 11 and 13. During tournaments, the game will exclusively match me against players with level 15 towers, and units that are between 14 and 16, or against players with level 9 towers and units that are between 7 and 10. There are no strategies that can overcome this gap. It is either an auto-win for me, or an auto-loss for me. Very poor game play experience.",2,2026-01-16 08:34:04

🚨GAMERS BEWARE🚨 I played this game since the month it came out. I maxed out every possible character and game mode. I Loved this game like a family memeber. So believe me when I say this This game now runs a pay to win cycle every season. You have to spend $30+ every season if you want the best cards. then come next season they will nurf it and release a better character. This cycle will never end until we put a stop to it. play other games that dont require you to pay,1,2026-02-01 11:29:48

I’ve had my account for over eight years, with at least four years of serious playing experience, yet it’s still hard to compete against paying players. Just when I was close to maxing my cards, they released the Evolution update and raised the level cap to 15, which requires either massive amounts of gold or significant real-money spending. and so much more...",1,2025-11-07 22:56:17

honestly this game is good it's fun it's not terrible but the biggest problem with it is you're trying to get more trophies basically ranked mode you win one game but you will lose your next six next 10 next 17 doesn't matter after you win a game you will always see something I can count on you you will always see executioner half the time nothing else I can really count on you and the next thing the game will bring up a witch or wizard and then you only see that for the next 10 games,2,2026-01-29 12:34:16
"The game is now finished after latest update. I honestly cannot believe they have now added another level after people have upgraded cards. I'm sick of the money grab this game has become, played since the beginning, almost 10 years, guess was fun while it lasted. so angry at the developers, greedy as hell",2,2025-11-25 02:13:40
it is too good but I am facing so many problems while login to the game. whenever I open the game it stuck at the loading screen. I don't know if it is the game's problem or what but my internet connection is good . please Supercell fix this ASAP 😮‍💨,2,2026-02-14 17:47:35
Heroes and Level 16 were never asked for. Supercell only care about the players who pay to win and not about the players who start on training camp and get to arena 25 without paying a single penny. Need to release more evos and more champion cards. The gameplay isnt too bad but the ethics of the game are poor.,1,2026-02-12 00:28:18
"It's a simple but great game. The only downside is the matchmaking, even if you're in a losing streak it still has slim chances to win, keyword ""slim"", because majority of your opponents gonna be pay to win or skillful which rigged the matchmaking so bad I almost quit the game which I will in the future if this won't be fixed. Please fix the matchmaking and stop adding weird overpowered units or features which will ruin the game for free to play players. That's all from me",2,2025-11-28 21:53:42
"fun but over time can be so boring , at the start you have fun learning cards and decks but ive hit 5/6k and im hard stuck everyone has higher level cards then me and i cant try out new cards because they arent high enough and the only way to get cards is by luck or your credit card , you feel forced to use the cards that you chose to upgrade, the game ""Could"" be fun if it gave you more items to upgrade so you could acc test and see what you like but you cant",1,2026-01-08 01:02:33
it's a very fun game that requires skill and experience... until Mega Knight. Then it's just a matter of which opponent can cycle it the fastest. it's so unfair for an actual real person like me who doesn't use Mega Knight when I'm trying to use skill and they just spam Mega Knight. I wish they would remove it. If it weren't Mega Knight this game is a 5 star all day long.,3,2026-01-03 00:08:04
"A great game that teaches patience and skill. It can be frustrating, but if you fight through it is very fun. It is hard to be a free to play player on this game, but I am. I have completed most the game. I love the chat with your clan. Clash Royale is a great game!",4,2026-01-26 09:25:48
you must spend money to play but can download the game and lose. played for many years and it has recently gone severly down hill with the influx of players from it being covered by a youtuber. hate to say it but playing 52card pick up is a better way to spend time. save yourself a headache and frustration unless you are willing to throw your wallet at the game. sad to see this happen to the game,1,2025-12-07 21:06:52
"I have had this game, for ages. It has been through many updates and I thought it couldn't get worse than when level 15 was introduced. With the new update level 16 has made the game unplayable not to mention the new champions. It has just made it so much harder to keep up and I don't understand why it was necessary. Nothing can be done about it but if you are a new player and you want to keep progressing it's even harder now.",1,2025-12-15 21:35:10
"match making sucks! I have played the game for a long time. I am a very good player. I lose a lot because the game will favour the other player. Many things happen like that, like the order of the cards are bad for me but great for the other player. This game helps the less skilled. After months of playing I accepted the way the game is. I love it, but is so completely unfair.",1,2025-12-17 17:41:58
This used to be my most beloved game in the world! Now they are just money grabbing and adding sheet they promise they would never add (new max levels etc) so I have to change my review from 5 to 1. I'm a 9-year player and I just deleted the game. Myclan can even finish all the games without bringing mini accounts in.. It's so sad...,1,2026-01-07 21:12:13
"This is a great game to improve your stratigies and intellegence because you find ways to counter stuff and the others find a way to your counter and it goes on and on. People figure out new pushes or counter attacks in Clash Royale, so in my opinion its not just a game but an improvement to your IQ and focus pretty much. Its a fun game so you should try this!",5,2025-11-28 07:04:52
"it is useless playing with computer. we want to play with real players and not with Ai. i have been playing this game for the past 9 years now. But nowadays i strongly feel that this game has become uselsss as we have been playing with a computer that knows all our moves and also knows the elixer count. i hate it that the computer also gives us a chance to win on purpose. it wants us to keep playing more, pushing for trophy. But as we progress, it wins us on by countering our troops😔😔😔",1,2025-12-01 00:46:14
"I used to love this game when not leveling up everytime your in a new arena, didnt make you less progressed then other now I play a match and instead of being put with somone with same level cards or even tower its someone very high leveled instead and its so often to the point playing isn't fun anymore, like theirs no skill anymore, and it makes it unfair for those who cant pay or just wanna play for a bit of fun",2,2025-12-31 17:36:36
"absolute cash grab. avoid at all costs. you will spend years on your account, leveling up your cards and your deck, and then they release a new card level and all of a sudden everyone you play against has spent tons of money and maxed out their cards, and now you legitimately cannot win as the levels throw off card interactions. plus every season they drop a new broken card that you have to have, and it costs money to unlock it. then a few months later after they got their money it gets nerfed!",1,2025-12-13 02:43:37
"look, clash was a good game I've been playing for 4 years and I have loved every single moment up until now when they started pumping pay to play and everything became unfair, and supercell you probably don't read these but if you do fix your game, learn what the players want and don't want. players are your main support and you treat them like they don't matter do better as company show people like Ubisoft and Activision how better games can be when it's fair for everyone. Do better supercell",2,2026-02-09 15:44:21
"At first glance, this game is amazing. You unlock new cards and new units and go against opponents in live exciting matches that utilize strategy and skill. Though this all falls off as you progress. The game becomes difficult to play and grindy, as you need to level up your cards to match your opponents. You can also pay for chests and magic items to level up your cards faster. Anyone who pays has a major advantage. Get this game only if you are willing to waste hours of your life or your cash",1,2026-02-14 09:44:59
good game. no ads. the only reason for the low stars is they use chests for coins when coins has its own icon. And takes too long to level up. dont expect all my cards to be maxed but I have way too many that are so low that I can only play a select few cards.also my dragon and balloon are 1 block from the castle and they come back to the river for a late tower. that is some lame cheat right there.,2,2025-12-07 12:44:12
"Worst. Update. Ever. The December season features many updates, including the Heroic rarity you can unlock for your cards, and the Level 16 update. IT'S THE WORST UPDATE IN THE GAME!!! The game has gotten even more ""pay to win"" than what it was before. You can't even progress in the game without having to face an opponent with a Level 16 deck, encouraging players to waste money in the game. And the in-app purchases are too much. I quit this money infested game.",1,2025-12-06 04:31:12

I used to play this on an alternate account than what I have today back when the game released and I used to have fun it was semi balanced but best of all I didn't have to spend money to upgrade I could beat people just based off skill and time but now with the removal of chests adding of lucky chests and then the hard nerf on the lucky chest as to how much loot they could bestow I am genuinely disappointed in what the company has done to this once wonderful game(also no one wanted lvl 16 cards),1,2025-12-02 12:22:31
"Good game but the match making, in the 1v1 showdown and in war, needs some serious work. A lvl 6 king tower shouldn't be matched up with a lvl 10, 11, 12, 13 or 14 king tower. It's very discouraging to want to play. Please fix it.",1,2026-02-14 21:43:11

I used to win nearly every match.. now I loose nearly ever match... why?? because i refuse to spend money. if your looking to spend tons of money and be unbeatable at a game this is the one for you. supercell may be one of the worst dev groups out there.,1,2026-01-21 22:37:52

"The game is really fun and has improved a lot over time. Earlier it felt pay-to-win, but now it’s enjoyable even without spending money. However, for the past few days I’ve been facing major network issues. The game often won’t log in unless I restart the app 3–4 times, and network errors keep occurring throughout entire matches. I hope this issue gets fixed soon, as it’s affecting an otherwise great experience.",4,2025-12-27 15:20:07
"Level 16 was already a terrible idea (especially for free to play players), but then you add the heroes who are upgrades of already great cards with broken abilities that make the game unplayable. the reason people like champions is because they are high risk cards that will greatly reward you if used correctly. unlike the champions, the heroes dont take skill to use whatsoever.",1,2025-12-14 12:30:07
"this game was so fun and easily one of the best mobile games ever, but after they added the level 16 and hero mechanics It has gotten way worse. It's hard to progress when you are free to play, and if you match up against someone who spends money it's easily there win",2,2026-01-08 13:42:17
"I used to enjoy this game. Now it's garbage. The AI/matchmaking is complete BS. It either puts you against someone that has all your counters or it shuffles your cards to where you can't counter. Try adjusting a deck for something you've been seeing a lot. Suddenly it switches. Then most people use the same 6 or 7 spam decks, they saw on youtube which gets boring quick. Then there's the new update with the ""heroes"". Total hack for people to p2p. It's no longer enjoyable.",1,2026-01-22 07:03:32
"Love this game - I've played since it came out. Lately, though, it has felt very unbalanced. For example, today someone I was playing dropped a hog rider, followed by a rocketeer, I countered, and he soon followed with lightning (13 elixer total). I turned my defensive troop offensive (this all took place on my side of the arena) and pushed with everything I had. This was to no avail. Not a single point of damage to his tower. This has happened very frequently lately.",3,2026-01-21 04:37:46
"Just a bafflingly horrible recent decision to add an extra level to the maximun for cards.

"Logic in this game is so flawed. Basically you get 1 game away from next arena, then the coding and matchmaking makes it that you face either an opponent higher arena level than you, or you face an opponent who has a deck perfect to counter your deck.

"This game is really fun, addictive, and the strategy is surprisingly complex and deep. Progression is satisfying. However, the game is incredibly pay-to-win. It is extremely commonplace to face opponents multiple levels higher than you, giving you essentially zero chance to win because they swiped their credit card. New updates like an upped level cap and the addition of heroes have only exacerbated this issue. Moreover, the meta is incredibly dominant. You always go up against the same decks.",4,2026-01-25 07:53:55

At frist till 2019 the game was great. After that the game only seems to getting worse. Every game I play I lose because my opponent has over leveled cards. ( I am at arena 19 with level 13 cards). Hero update was good but level 16 ruined it. The game is extremely pay to win.

"Upsides The game is fun, up until mid-ladder, and I like the evolution concept. Downsides Make It so I don't go up against a level 14 player when I have level 10 stuff in clan wars. It is just downright annoying. Also, nerf that stupid megaknight, make it cost 8 elixir and drop it's damage by 10 percent.

"it's a relatively good game because the play style is easy to learn and understand, it gives you a challenge, you beat it, repeat.(edit nov 6 2025) I'm gonna reword that, it's basic and somewhat difficult depending on who you fight. I'm making a 2 stars now from my original 4 because of how pay-2-win it is, and it's not even closely put together how some people are just so good at the game or annoying. it would be nice to be able to be matched with opponents that you can actually beat.",2,2025-11-07 06:25:46

It seems like all supercell cares about anymore is money, and if you don't have money, well too bad for you. It's easier than ever for people to pay to win while harder than ever for people to play for free. The additions of evolutions and heros has only made this worse. I used to love this game, now I'm just saddened by what it's become.",2,2026-01-09 00:00:42
Fun but game play is highly imbalanced and matchmaking is poorly handled. Unfortunately I have tried it off and on for over a year now and it seems to get better for a while and then some update happens that completely changes the balance again. That being said the game itself is well done. The current update has some imbalance with a core mechanic called elixir that some generate at nearly double the rate of others with no explanation of why. It's easy to figure out if you count the elixir.,2,2026-01-17 05:36:27
"As of January, 2026, with the most recent updates, the new season especially, the game has lost its touch.

"literally every update I wonder if you guys actually think before you make your changes. So let me get this straight you just took away all of the cards that I built up over years of playing the game and turned them in to gems, raised the level cap and now instead of having tons of resources to level up cards I have none. And most of that was made thru season passes I paid for. you people are unbelievable. Make what we earned useless to make us spend more money.",1,2025-11-24 19:35:22

Stop spiking my cortisol. Matchmaking puts me in with level 16 cards when my deck is primarily level 14. HUGE difference for free to play. The game is extremely pay to win dropping new things for you to buy every month that gives you an unfair advantage until it's inevitably nerfed. Dropping a new level is the worst decision this game could've made. The best part of this game is playing with friends where all your cards are the same level.,1,2026-01-17 09:30:06

what the hell is this? my game doen't open even if delete the game and reinstall it. use my network or wifi it doesnt open. sometimes. even if it opens cannoy enter a match. no problem with network only this game doesn't work. And this has been happening from 3 days,1,2026-02-14 12:52:54
"been a player for 6 years now, playing the game sometimes to spend time but it's just too Pay to win! not to mention the enemies you play againts if you happen to win a single game💔 its a horrible game, basically unplayable if u don't spend money on the game.🥀",1,2025-12-05 04:39:51
"I came back to the game after leaving for years and was having fun. I joined a clan and started building some new decks, and even bought the season pass a few times. but the company changes the game periodically and spoiled it again just when I got decent decks. I don't pay attention to forums or feeds but it feels like the company does what they want without concern for who gets burned or disappointed with the game. I won't be back.",2,2025-11-25 21:24:18
I quit buying the monthly pass as the mystery boxes take too long to open. placed on a cool down! tf I didn't abandon anything. I did my war battles returned to see im on a cool down. the game is getting worse and worse with every update. what's with the halftime show for the Superbowl? the halftime show is a travesty to true Americans,1,2026-02-09 06:37:59
"decent, but pay to win, so it's not fun if you get decently far for free. matchmaking is abysmal and it puts you against people with 3 level higher troops. you'd think a game this old would be balanced better by now smh or at least easier to level up cards for free to play people. Very unbalanced game mechanics, do not play if you want something competitive",1,2025-12-06 06:38:31
"Pay to win game. early phase of the game is well balanced and funn, later phase when you get stronger you start to get player that is much better than you. especialy player who is not in clan they are fixed to win the game. so you can win 10 games than lose 20 or so and later you will advanced very very slowly if you dont pay and buy chest and upgrades.",1,2025-11-27 01:54:19
"If you have decent internet, it's fun, but when you have a sudden service loss or spotty wifi, enjoy getting your opponent play while you can't. I'm going to uninstall over the frustration this builds. One moment you're winning, then there's a freeze or you can no longer place units. And all you can do is watch your opponent proceed to get the upper hand and accept your loss.",2,2025-12-31 13:29:54
"Clash Royale is a fantastic game owned by the greediest most awful game company imaginable. They insist on setting back progression and screwing over anyone trying to succeed in ranked. Leveling a level 15 card to a level 16 card costs 3000 gems, which is the equivalent of 23 real life dollars. This is a stunning price increase from the previous already terrible system where it costed 8 dollars to get a card from level 14 to 15. Do not get this game. You cannot succeed in this game as a F2P.",1,2025-11-27 01:54:12
"it's a great game, and I have been playing for about 5 years. I keep had to getting new accounts as a new phone, but then I got a supercell ID. Everything was fine until around September 2025. The game got way too popular. My friends have been playing for like a month and they are in pancakes. a joke. They just spent so much money on the game, and it's just not fun. in arena 15 I met someone who had level 14 king tower and all level 14 cards. The game win. level 16! this game ment so, Much.....",3,2025-12-07 02:11:54
"updating my review because this game has taken a massive turn to p2w. my latest dislike of the game has been the gifts, they seriously gotta show they care about the community some how and loot boxes ARE NOT the way. I don't think fast progression is possible at all in any of the game mods, you have to buy things in order to even have access to all the cards in due time. (took me years in fp2).",2,2025-12-27 00:47:59
"I loved this game so much, i used to play it everyday for hours but after lvl16 and the ""heros"" i barely touch it and it now this game depends on pay-to-win, most of it. They are not listening to us and are persisting in their mistake.",1,2026-02-13 14:34:19
"coming back to play after years is a lot of fun. no pay to play is necessary. the way they do chest now and how easy it is to get gold there's really no need to pay any money to be competitive unless you just simply lack the skill. the new stuff is fun too, just gotta get used to how the game plays now. It's a lot more fun with heroes being added and card evolutions. you just gotta be adaptable",5,2026-01-31 07:02:30
"Ive played this game since the start. the new update just made it bad, yes there are advantages but the bad thing is that players can easily upgrade their card through purchases while some players don't have that type of option available and so it makes battles unfair, even if you are both on the same level.(e.g. if both players are Lv 14, the other players (opponent) might have cards that are Lv 15 or even 16), that just makes the match harder and ultimately makes you not want to play anymore.",3,2025-12-12 14:33:37
"Fair play there isn't anything like that in this game.. Pay to win is more likely.. Every match I play with player with two lvl higher cards than mine and guess what they have all evolutions unlocked SHOCKER! How do you play against that, there is only one way PAYING to win.. if you don't balance this problem the game is GARBAGE",1,2025-12-26 06:17:25
"love the game, definitely pay to win, I feel I was kinda forced to spend some money on the game to be able to compete with people who spend their wallets on the game. With that said it is a strategy based game so you still have a fair chance regardless. I also think 2v2's should get a little more diversity like adding different game mode types and also please put a rematch button in 2v2's lol.",3,2026-01-21 03:53:31
been playing for 9 years and it's always been fun until they decided to make everything about money. level 16? money required to get those faster than like 1 card per month. heros? 9% chance to get all 4 if you roll 4 times bc you can get duplicates. you have to pay for those too. and evos? they stopped seeing them and decided to keep adding more pay to win heros. thanks for ruining one of the best games of all time supercell 👍,2,2025-12-28 09:16:30
"Clash Royale is considered pay-to-win because spending money allows players to significantly speed up card progression, reach higher levels faster, and gain access to powerful new cards and upgrades (like Evolutions and Level 15) quicker, giving them an unfair advantage over free-to-play players in the ladder system, where card levels matter immensely for success. While skill is crucial, paying removes the grinding process.I'd also like to know why I have to restart my game about 3 during a game",1,2026-01-09 07:04:28
"impossible to play on pc, game freezes when loading in at 100%, and if i do get into the game, in the middle of most matches the game completely freezes, so i have to restart and hope i can get a match where i can actually play. this has cost me lots of trophies",1,2025-12-22 14:32:00
"I've been playing this game for a few years. I think it's a fun strategy game. I chose to leave this review because I don't like some of their business practices. I'm typically not a fan of pay to win games, even if there are matches where your opponent has the upper hand because they have a slightly higher leveled card. but it's the small things they do, like the card offers in the shop sometimes costing gems. I like the game, but I do not think supercell respects my time.",3,2025-12-04 00:39:02
"Used to be a really fun game but has taken a turn to greed. every thing is now P2W as well as the developers not fixing bugs that have existed in the game for months. creating a while new cash grab system (Heros) even though the previous system (Evos) was not even finished. community managers do not respond to any user feedback and then proceed to state that ""When a great team of developers work on a game, it will always be popular"" even though only 3rd party creators only brought popularity.",1,2026-02-13 17:33:07
"It's a pretty good game, but the fun gets ruined every 5 games or so when a pay-to-win player with cards 4 levels higher than yours absolutely incinerates you and then proceeds to spam emotes for a minute straight. Not Supercell's fault, but it's still an issue.",4,2025-12-07 01:50:56
played for 4 years reached Ultimate Champion 4 times and played over 10k games. Throughout the years this game doesn't seem to stop disappointing me every update. Every update is power creep and it is exclusive to paid road. To casual players like myself this is a huge set back for competitive play as I get level gapped or card locked as they are brand new. The dev team doesn't listen to content creators or community..,1,2026-01-08 01:08:10
"Most pay to win game I've ever seen. You either don't spend money and have no fun and don't enjoy the game, or you spend money and steamroll anyone who hasn't. That is how the game works. Supercell nerfs progression over and over again with every update and continues to ignore the player base. Do yourself a favour and don't play this game.",2,2026-01-07 02:51:34
"This game is really fun, but losing 30 trophies for losing one round is a bit much, and I think it's very tempting to fall back down after we've risen so high. And paying to win is ridiculous, especially when kids are playing. But still, the game is very fun and strategy-based",4,2026-01-13 00:32:13
Pay To Play now. last update took away the ability for Free to ppay players to obtain new items. I'm all for no wait times on chests but removing the shop where players can pick and choose what they can buy was fun and only way for free to play players to advance. they got greedy and removed that so you get wayy less stuff. it will take so much longer for new and current players to grind for stuff. Updated** now they removed ALL of your card books without option of even spending them,1,2025-11-24 23:59:15
Game is complete joke. The game has become completely pay to win from the battlepass to broken evolutions. There is pretty much no balancing involved on how much can someone spend in the game and get huge advantage. Game is playable for a free user until 7000 trophies and then it matches you with people who have 2 broken evolutions and lvl 13/14 cards. And now the heroes are being introduced that is even more pay to win.,1,2025-11-25 01:38:03
"I mean bro everything about this game is just so frustrating and its sad because the game has so much potential to be good but greedy supercell devs just refuse to save the game and instead just drive it straight to the ground they know whats wrong with the game few examples are balancing, repetitiveness, its completely pay to win, impossible to progress fast, the matchmaking is rigged etc there's so many issues with this game its insane I recommend no one ever downloads it or deletes it",1,2026-01-28 06:26:22
"I wish I could give it -5 star rating. 1st they introduce another cash grab level, again. Now even the game is buggy. Cant login half the time. Game has connectivity issues. And in clan war match champion ability button is not even there. This game should be removed from play store.",1,2025-12-20 22:46:51
The game is rigged. They proved time and time again that the chest drops ARE NOT random. They use events to lure you into spending resources before updates that change the way resources work. making you a loss. So FEW players even play anymore that they use bots to counter the huge que times. They releasd OP cards in order to FORCE you to buy them and THEN nurf them into the ground. then repeat the process.,1,2026-02-01 20:00:48
"Completely pay to win trash game. When youwin a bit consecutive matches,they will deliberately match you with someone who has counter to every single one of your cards.

"I don't like the update. Supercell has found a way to make even more money off the game. You can now pay to upgrade cards with gems. At this point we've hit the Star Wars Sequel trilogy era of Clash Royale. It was good. it felt like the game may have been a little bloated with evos, but they grew on me, still not great, kind of unnecessary. Now they've just done too much. They gave the cow roids and force fed it to milk it even more. it's big fat and bloated.",2,2025-12-05 09:56:58
good game but i am finding a lot of cheaters as i struggle getting a 2 elixir when the other player is getting a 5+ and another 5+ with in seconds which is not possible at the same rate im doing 2 and 3. can I suggest as there is a time limit there is a max amount you can spend (elixir) with in a time frame and that be monitored some how.,2,2025-12-15 15:08:46
"there's too much no skill players and the new heros? hero Giant was given out the most and its the worst one. they're trying to milk you of your cash because their evil and greedy. you have to buy hero mini pekka to even have a chance at winning. and theres way too much cards that are overused. I personally think they are braindead humans if their even human at all, I think they're just this insect that nobody likes. and the matchmaking is actually proven to be against you. don't play this game.",1,2025-12-23 10:04:50
"I love this game so much, Supercell has made it super easy to start a new account with all the shop offers that come out ever week. For only a couple hundred dollars you can max your whole deck without having to play at all. Not including that every update helps people spend more irl money on cards so you can have a bigger advantage. I rate this game a 5/5 its the best game ever and they love my moms credit card for all the in shop offers.",5,2025-12-01 02:38:12

"Money sucker! The game is fantastic. It's highly addictive once you get the feel of it. One thing which If found annoying is when you are in battle mode and you get matched against an opponent f higher your level. Its very difficult to beat them since the health of their cards is much more. Ergo,I wish we get matched according to king tower levels in battle instead of number of trophies. That would be a level playing field. also, gameplay sucks on mobile internet. I hope fix it.",3,2025-11-25 01:43:57

"I started playing this game in 2016, gameplay is good but the company comes with the most dumb ideas to ruin the game. This is coming from a veteran player who has been playing this game since 2016, this is a highly p2w game, skills matter less than card levels and how many overpowered Heroes & Evolutions are in your deck. unfair advantage makes a huge difference for your chances to win and lose the game.",1,2026-02-04 07:03:16
"the game dictates how you win or lose if you spend money it lets you climb if not the game keeps you low, my level 15 troops and king are getting beat by level 11 & 12 troops, dont waste your time on the game SuperCell are getting greedy trying to get you to spend more money, the game is generally to hard now and you cant move up the table anymore. there is absolutely no point in spending money to upgrade troops as you get beat by 3 levels below your troops",1,2025-11-27 20:16:56
"The mechanics were unique, fun and evolutionary. However, to reach higher levels you have to use broken cards for a time till you reach really high level arenas.

Latest update punishes free to play players who managed to get lvl 14/15 cards. Any bit of progress they would have been earning has been lost to make way for players willing to pay exorbitant amounts of money to max their cards again. The current dynamic SUPERCEL has come to is raise the max level of cards whenever their top whales stop spending money at the selling out of everyone else.

"The game is completely abandoned, the devs really wanted to milk out the players as much as they could during their 2025 peak and now all that's left is a shitshow of a game. The game balance is terrible, the progression is now non existent and it's now based on it ""lucky drops"" which are rigged (there's proof) to give you mainly useless coins.

"This game is an absolute banger, Supercell's take on real time strategy with millions of different possibilities at the tip of your fingers is incredibly well executed overall, that being said, in its current state I'd say it can become frustrating to play as its pay to fast scheme gives players too much of an advantage over free to play. This issue has been growing worse over time, leaving certain players outside of the competitive scene. All in all, great game, HORRENDOUS progression.",2,2025-11-25 19:50:01
"Its just a shame to see this go from a fun game where the developers cared about the fan base, to something i had to Uninstall for the sheer amount of pay-to-win mechanics, alongside the developers failing to provide fun and new changes during updates. Clan wars is ruined, ladder is ruined, the game is ruined. update as of 2025. They added heroes, all the problems I previously mentioned are now even more severe. It's pathetic really.",1,2025-11-27 01:49:03
"The main gameplay loop is pretty fun, but it's so blatantly pay-to-win. ""Buy the battle pass! Buy evos! Buy wild cards! No more timed chests, because that would mean that you don't have your free cards heavily throttled to incentivize buying overpriced wild cards! Buy legends! Buy champions! Buy, buy, buy!"" How about I don't. Don't get this game. The only viable card is your debit card.",1,2025-12-02 11:21:15
"This game could have been fun, but instead, it has mega knight and other badly integrated cards that make no sense to be in a game. this game is so P2W that it is disgusting. granted, yes, I still play this game because it IS fun. BUT, it is toxic, P2W, trashy, and overall unbalanced.",1,2026-02-07 01:20:54
"where did my book of cards go? for any newcomers, you may love this game but it used to be way better, an original game. it was simple, now it's got abilities and other things. And this game is very p2w (pay to win) meaning that if you are a free to play player (like me) this game is a nightmare however it still keeps me addicted.",1,2025-11-25 03:27:26
I've been playing for 9 years. I've never changed a rating like this before. evos started a decline in this game. they can be fun i guess but now heros and the new changes are ruining the experience. part of what made and kept the game fun was it wasn't full of gimmicks. you leveled and that was it. the devs more and more dont listen to feedback.,2,2025-12-19 19:35:59
heroes and Evos have completely ruined this game. it used to be about positive elixir trades. now you just play defence for 2 minutes until you have your Evo's and hope it works. not to mention the plethora of glitches involving buildings and it effecting unit placement. now the musketeer can spawn a building which can physically stop you from placing a troop where you want. don't get it twisted. THIS IS NOT A GOOD GAME. This is a PRODUCT that MAKES MONEY. nothing more nothing less.,2,2025-12-26 07:28:46
"First time I've updated this review since 2019. The last few updates, including level 16, lucky drops, and last and certainly least being HEROES, have completely destroyed the identity of Clash Royale. Or, as it should be referred to now, Cash Royale. I still play a couple times a week, and the game is functional, but Supercell is suddenly in maximum greed mode.",2,2026-01-05 14:04:07
"this game is fun at its core, but is incredibly pay to win. I don't have a problem spending money on mobile games, but you can literally dump thousands of dollars into this game and still never have everything maxed out. It's incredibly frustrating when the balancing team lets openly broken cards go without nerfs for months on end.",1,2025-12-25 21:42:09
"I honestly don't no what you have done with game, but I honestly feel like you pick and choose when the game works properly.. I've contacted alot over the last couple of months saying that the card delay is beyond a joke by the time a card is actually put down on screen it's just to late, either there at the castle already or it pauses my elixir and I'm behind because of it.. I don't mind losing but when it feels like I litterally have no chance due to this is pointless even playing..",2,2026-01-09 16:27:36
"This game was very good at the start but when they decided to make progression harder, and making the game more pay to win killed it, which made me decide to quit, I would not recomend if free to play.",3,2026-02-12 04:46:48
"wow wow wow one of the most addictive games I've played. apart from the gameplay like never ever have I seen a add in this game. about the game its just incredible. I've probablly gonna play this for the rest of my life, very good game 👍 I recommend this game for more people that likes strategic games, good job supercell. WOULD RECOMMEND TRYING",5,2026-02-12 20:20:15
"Game is terrible. It's a cash grab with everyone just running the same no skill decks. your opponent always has more elixir than you some how. Easily the worst game ever made and its not even a debate. what ever you do dont play this game it takes everything from you time, money, sanity you name it. Overall would not recommend there are so many better games that you could play and this game is not on of them. Evos, Heros, Champions, and lvl 16 shouldnt have been added to the game.",1,2026-01-13 14:06:07
"honestly no words. Used to be the best game there was to play on the phone, but now with the additions of heroes and other stuff, and so many bugs, it's not as fun as it used to be, free to play is so hard to advance unfortunately.",1,2025-12-09 22:55:34
"Can be fun. Expect to win one out of five matches if you don't want to spend money. Some players will out spawn you, two or three to one, I assume they are spending money or hacking to do it.",1,2026-02-09 21:55:51
"PAY TO WIN. I get destroyed playing people with higher lvl cards. It's absurd. Is it too much to ask to play someone my lvl cards or EVEN CLOSE? With 10 minute matchmaking you would think matchups. would be better. This is the definition of pay to win. If i can tell the guy has max cards, why can't your algorithms?its a simple "">"". Learn to code. This is daily. Do you even read these? After more of the same, this will stay 1 star forever, even future updates. Enjoy it, jerks. 1 star ratings: x26",1,2026-02-01 10:34:56
"i like this game so much so I return after years of not playing it, but the connection is suck. not only the loading is extremely long and stuck at ±98%, in game also very laggy and lead to many defeat -_- i guess the only thing they spent is for evos and not of fixing the connection",1,2026-01-26 01:20:40
Was a great game at start. But it's increasingly more and more pay to win. Not to mention the devs recent updates have enraged the entire community and they don't seem to care. After 2 months I finally get my first hero and it's the worst one possible. I guess I'm going to quit until it's balanced at the very least. But the devs seriously need to get their priority straight. Start caring about the dying community they have rather than a cash grab.,1,2025-12-27 10:15:03
"very fun but you can get very mad when you lose a ton of matches in a row, and you can't really win them back fast because you just keep losing, causing a love-hate relationship because its fun to win a lot and play with your friends and also getting the cards throughout the arenas and it just feels so awarding to get to the next arena or card you've finally reached knowing you've worked so hard to get there.👍 I would recommend getting the game.",4,2025-12-10 10:20:48
"Horrible game(i mean horrible) it is so pay to win! Clash Royale has devolved into a frustrating pay-to-win experience that prioritizes monetization over fair gameplay. The constant introduction of ""Evolutions"" and Level 15 has created a massive power gap, making it nearly impossible for free-to-play players to compete in the higher leagues. ​The game’s matchmaking often feels rigged pairing players against higher level players.",1,2026-01-24 08:22:56
"very play to win, you'll see people in the match over level and having a deck which just came out and most of everyone doesn't have them. gets boring, developer adding things that we don't need and is making the game mechanics kinda bad while instead of fixing stuff we really needed. so far this game is just seating in my phone without me touching.",1,2025-12-07 12:48:23
After 2 years of playing this I changed my review to 1 star. because just in the latest update there's level 16 for cards and I'm a free to play player and I struggled already with leveling up with my cards but clash royale has to be money hungry and ruining it's fan base just for a cash quick thingy. I might just go back to brawl stars because it's not worth playing while having pay 2 win people always in your game.,1,2025-12-20 00:42:00
"I have played for 10 years. was good in the beginning, but with every major update supercell likes to make their game worse. They're making the most money they have ever made, and yet the still fail to make their game better. level 16 cap is useless. getting rid of magical items just made it more inconvenient to progress. the addition of heros makes absolutely no sense and devalues the point of champions (it's an obvious cash grab). clan wars is outdated and boring. nerf the credit card.",1,2025-11-26 06:22:44
"Such an awful game it's crashing everytime I'm trying to play since yesterday, even after I reported the bug multiple times, uninstalling and installing the game thrice, clearing cache, restarting phone but none of it is of any help. Such a buggy game also supercell has scammed me recently when I played squard busters for hours but didn't receive any reward instead.",1,2025-12-06 23:46:15
"I've been playing this game for a long time, and I really love it, but every time they make changes, things get broken. For example, after they release new heroes, their abilities are unavailable in clan wars for weeks — there is simply no button for them. This is very annoying, because you've paid for this, and in the end you don't get what you paid for. Do you just not see these bugs, or do you simply ignore them?",4,2025-12-31 18:32:55
"I have two humble suggestions that could make the 2 vs 2 gaming experience even better: 👉 In 2 vs 2 matches, if a player leaves mid-game, an auto-play feature should activate instantly to take their place. This will ensure the remaining teammate doesn’t feel disadvantaged or regretful, and the match can continue smoothly. 👉 After every 2 vs 2 match, a “Player of the Match” highlight should be displayed immediately, so that out of the four players, everyone can see who delivered the best.",5,2025-11-25 04:08:55
"I have been playing this game since 2016. Can we get an equal platform here? Why has this game become a ""pay to win""? It isn't supposed to be a platform where a person puts his money and gets all the good cards and has the max level of each and every card. This game was good in the past. Now it is a clear Pay to win game!",1,2026-01-20 19:26:42
"The game has become a pay to win. -3/27/24 Payed to win, bots with perfect ai, they try to hide it, pay to win, must have money to enjoy or play for a while (I have for 6 7 years) and it's pay to win. They ruined the game ()",1,2026-02-10 16:02:01
"this game has become unplayable, it's just sad, the game is so off balance at the moment, there are cards that are simply impossible to play against, it's not fair what they did to this game, I just don't enjoy play it anymore, I thought it was only me a casual player but even the Pro Players are suffering, what can we expect then? the game is at a horrible stage right now, it's sad because it's my favorite game of all times, but I'm seriously thinking of uninstalling it after almost 10 years",1,2025-12-24 06:49:10
"Duplicates of heroes, lvl 16 & drop rates - now openly trying to milk more money instead of doing more content, which actually they cofirmed themselves.

clash is a great game but it has some issues I personally can't look past. The main one being how pay to win it became. once you hit a certain point in the trophy road it becomes really hard to lvl your cards without spending some dough. heroes blow and evos are cool. also having only four lucky chests a day sucks. only play four games a day so I can maximize my card gain.,3,2026-01-05 23:21:59
They've removed helpful items from the game and intentionally slowed progression so it is no longer fun or rewarding to play. Other players can use real money to bypass progression and gain the advantage. They've removed anything that could be helpful to free players,1,2025-12-13 22:40:47
"It was a really fun game but they kinda killed it, no longer deserves the high rating, very hard to find a more unbalanced and pay to win game. I only play draft with friends now. No one kills games faster than supercell lol.",1,2026-02-02 05:45:43
"so this new update is ridiculous. It just shows how greedy supercell is sometimes. So I spent 5 years as a f2p player and I finally maxed out a deck and now y'all add lvl 15 and 16??? This is insane. Everyone I play has basically a full lvl above me. Catering to the people that pay. Don't get me wrong it's fun and if you're skilled you can beat a lot of people, but I'm just an average player. So grinding to 10k after taking a couple years off the game, imma put it to rest again. pmo supercell",2,2025-11-28 18:23:07
"genuinely one of the worst games i have EVER played. none of the matchmaking makes sense, there is no skill based matchmaking, 99% of the player are pay to win and there is quite literally nothing you can do to counterplay. this game is dogshit beyond comprehension, enemy players NEVER run out of elixer despite playing tanks back to back to back. i would recommend this game to nobody.",1,2025-12-05 17:19:49
"This game will dry your wallet if you decide to play this game without spending money just play other games. The game is fun until you play against players who spend too much money on this cash grab. Recent updates are doubling down on that, removing features that help f2p in favor of features that make you spend money in order to enjoy the game. if you plan to play this casually, the game is actually fun until a point. this is a warning",1,2025-11-26 15:40:48

In arena 5 there's some player that who already have some decks that is level 13 or 11 like isn't that unfair? a player with high level of deck unlike me whos deck is very low compared to the ptw players. however, theres some BUGS in your game like you can't spawn your deck EVEN though your not lagging likely your actually not and its just the bug and I'm hoping you'll see this review and this is what im favoring that you need to check your game and make a balanced game",1,2026-02-01 11:33:07
"Unfortunately it has come to this after playing for years the developers have hit the the self destruct button, all people want to do is play on the same level as everyone else but with this game that’s an impossibility, the only people that can afford this game now are YouTubers that are partly supported by the developer and who are earning off YouTube.",2,2026-01-06 09:44:13
It's a money thirsty game. If you don't cash you can't enjoy the game. Enjoy clashing with an opponent with close to max cards while you only have like lvl11 cards. They just steam roll you due to levels.,1,2026-02-07 19:42:57
"well, it's a good game, but still the owners are kinda greedy with them trying to squeeze every drop of money out of the player base. they continue to do nothing to help f2p players, and really only focus on money. it's hard when people pay 12 dollars for a full level megaknight, and they suck at the game as they plop it down and think they are smart.",1,2025-12-20 02:08:55
the game was good but the pay to win aspect is eating the game alive where only the people who Invested in the game only have a small fighting chance after the level 16 and the removal of books and poor reimbursement for said books make the creators thieves of the player base it still has aspects I like about it but its going down hill fast and a poor choice for new players looking for something casual with fair development.,1,2026-01-09 10:43:03

I quit playing because of how pay to win this game is and don't even get me started on the player base. People will leave their clan just to join yours to make fun of you if you lose and even sometimes if you win, then leave. Anyways 2/10 game would not recommend, its kind of a good passtime SOMETIMES. You suck GreedyCell.",1,2026-01-04 14:54:32

But now I m so disappointed as it has so many unnecessary mechanism like lvl 16, heroes, old days chests & season shops are removed. It's so hard for F2P players to just max out a single deck. So much potential to the game is still untouched & the skill doesn't matter anymore, lvl & money does. I hope they fix & make game playable again.",2,2026-01-28 17:16:11

So if ever happens to you, it takes you back to the beginning, just uninstall and install on the game.",1,2025-12-09 06:06:50
For how many hours I have played this game I cannot recommend it. The greed from supercell is too much to ignore. They raise card levels so that people buy more overpriced packs.

There's still people who use homemade decks that take skill and I applaud those people but mid ladder is literal agony especially with the hero mini pekka, I would not recommend this game to anyone anymore due to the games state.",1,2025-12-24 06:30:46

Nobody wins on skill, it all comes down to the deck match up, you win if the game wants you too. Stupid AF",1,2026-01-09 13:30:45
Broken game. Uninstall. As soon as evos were introduced skill and time invested was moved to the back burner. Clash Royale is pay to win 100%.

This game is fun, but newly updated cards are just too op to be released. Adding level 16, whose idea was that. Changing to level 15 almost killed the game, now this. Heroics also make the game harder and new for players. Pls for future heroics or evos make them balance and maybe it can result in a more fun and balanced game.",3,2025-11-29 21:07:47
"Don't start this. The algorithm is balls. You do not get to play against random people/decks. You keep playing against the same decks, because the algorithm dictates what SUPERCELL believes to be a epic match. Also, most of the players go about it in a ""monkey-see-monkey-do"" way. I have not ONCE in all my 7 years of playing been put in a match against someone with the same deck as me! Do not listen to good reviews. I warn you. Except if you like pay to win games and are prepared to be bored🥱",1,2026-01-28 19:48:25
"updated post: changing to 1 star. once you hit around 8000 trophies, there's not point of playing anymore. I'm running into people who have been playing for 8 years and have maxed out everything against my underpowered jank and keep getting swept every match. old post: overall fun experience for a while before you max out and have to pay to play. two major knocks against it: matchmaking system on the ladder is the worst I've seen in any game and their customer support ignores you.",1,2025-12-29 04:30:39
"this game is fun and i have played it for many years but theres a problem and it aint just one its many. the game is SUPER p2w half the stuff only cost money and its imppssible to get heros and evelutions without p2w unless you grind for months and these matchs are just absurd MEGAKNIGHT EVERY TIME ITS NOT EVEN STRONG, ITS JUST REPETITIVE AND ANNOYING and its IMPOSSIBLE TO WIN IN LADDER lvl 10 vs lvl 13 or lvl 12 vs 16 its personally fun but its just to p2w and even without p2w its impossible",2,2026-02-05 02:01:35

"I give 1 star because it's the minimum you can do, it's a frode game, it's control your cards, it's control your gameplay by giving card's you can attack and defend, the algorithm control your game play. ut doesn't matter how how hard you try, for example 'if you lose 3-4 time then the 5th time you play you will win without any trouble, you don't have to try hard, try it.",1,2026-01-07 03:29:27

experiencing random crashes in the middle of battles and long loading 
times. This has never happened before, and I have been playing the game 
since it was released, using several different accounts. Other than that, 
its great, and I like the new clan wars feature. EDIT: Several months on 
from my last review, I am still suffering from the same problems. Please 
fix this! Its not my internet.",4,2025-12-13 05:12:01
it's a super fun game in the beginning but as you progress things get a lot harder fast. There are people that pay to get better at the game which make things a lot harder. but over all the game is decently fun and a good strategy game.,3,2026-01-01 07:24:25
"some of the cards or boosts they've introduced are just absurd, you cant do anything against them and its primarily based on people paying for them, meaning you cant compete. id deleted the game for a long time and just reinstalled it, I will be deleting it again.",1,2026-01-29 19:06:46
"game is fine, but every update makes one feature slightly worse. Bring back chest queues and earning chests. lucky loop timer is awful. there is actually no point to playing if you aren't willing to drop tons of money or be forced to accept no progression after a handful of games a day",1,2026-01-02 09:33:52
NEW UPDATE. Still 1 star. Now they use an algorithm to see how many times you've won to give you the feeling of winning. Now you literally can't even ptw(which is nice) because they will place you with people 7000 + trophy count because you have been winning. Even if youre trophys are 5800... If you're wondering I have been playing six years so I will tell you many years ago it was okay but this is my second 1 star review. Don't waste time on this game. ( it got worse somehow ) update,1,2025-11-26 09:09:32

"supercell, do you even play your own game? Well, you clearly don't. This game used to be so good, I used to enjoy playing this, and now I hate every second I play this game. It is the most pay to win game ever, and these uptates with the heroes? You definitely on something to think that heroes are fair and balanced. It's just a repeat every time, release a new broken card, have everyone buy it, and then nerf it to the ground until it's unusable.

I normaly play merge tactics but with the new season of course they had to add pay to win. Because now if you buy the forage machine. you pretty much win everytime because only the people that buy that get two defense cards on the field. So now it's not enjoyable to play anymore.,2,2026-01-06 07:16:50
Uninstalled today because of the pay to win system. I liked the idea of having to level your troops up and i get that as you go higher in the rankings they would get stronger. level 15 troops at 7500 is abysmal. its not even 1 or 2 players either. ive seen videos of how much it would cost to upgrade too. Cant even blame the people buying it. of course you would if you enjoyed the game and had disposable income. Greedy company taking advantage of that. Let people pay for skins like other games.,1,2025-11-25 22:39:37
I have had a 5 star review since 2018 on play store for clash. i have the 9 years badge. and today i am down voting it to 1 stars. you want F2P off your app ? okay. just add it in the term and conditions. agressif algorithm to keep you addicted. Virtually no rewards without paying. fix the game before demanding we pay.,1,2025-12-11 01:14:14

Great that there is no other way troop that defends witch that has a less elixir cost. yay. to wrap it up, I just wanted to say that playing clash royale has ruined the mindset i have for competitive games. I rage far too much now. Thanks a lot, supercell. also,way better 5 years ago. when it was actually fun.",1,2026-01-27 11:11:46
you guys have ruined my favorite game I have played since I was a kid in multiple different accounts I have restarted trophy road many times . I remember when I got my first legendary i was in grade 8 I was so happy but now I try and play and it's okay to win in many ways you guys have failed so many of us free to play players it's pathetic. I'm highly disappointed I no longer want to play what has been my favorite game for many years. it's sad such a huge company is so money hungry 0 out of 10,1,2026-01-24 16:55:57
"offensively pay to win game. introduced level 16 for no reason other than to make people pay up, couldn't even try justifying it in any way. every month they introduce 2 new broken heroes that put you at a disadvantage if you don't spend 15 USD to buy them.",1,2026-02-13 23:15:48
"I see a lot of ppl say this game is PTW, and to an extent they're right. If you pay, you can get the new flashy cards immediately. However, I have never spent a single cent on this game and I can always keep up. Theres always a new event out that I can get Evo shards from, and leveling up troops isn't even that hard. I play around 15mins a day and while every once in a while someone is way over leveled, it's less common than a lot of these comments make you think.",4,2025-11-25 10:28:44
"this game is absolutely horrible. its purely carried by its player base and content creators. the balancing is non existent, the recent updates have been extremely unoriginal dry. all the developers care about is making a quick buck, at the expense of the players. it hasn't just happened once, every update has been trash for the last three years. there's no soul in the game anymore. zero passion from the developers, and zero care for the player. if you are reading this please do not download it",1,2025-12-05 23:56:25
"It's a fine game, quite fun, but what annoys me is the fact that sometimes when you're playing suddenly you're against a person with waaaay stronger cards as they are most likely p2w and way higher king tower level which honeslty- shouldn't happen. You shouldn't have to spend money to win. The higher levels should go against higher levels not lower ones. Fix your game genuinely.",3,2026-01-09 18:33:49
"This is a 5 star game, but the pay to win is ridiculous! Obviously they don't care at all about the free to play and casual players cuz they're just interested in making money. Can't say I blame a business for wanting to make money... It just used to be such a great cuz you got out of it exactly what you put into it with time and skill. Now neither of those matter, especially with the evos. It's such a bummer cuz you know it's not going back to how it was. They are going the way of COD. sad",1,2025-12-05 14:15:44
The game sucks It's not the same as it used to be these updates just keep getting WORSE I can't believe heroes are actually in the game and I HATE it. nowadays it's P2W. The only thing good about the updated is merge tactics that are better than any update they had last year's it but i know they'll make it worse and p2w. The only reason I'm still playing this game is for my clan and friends I fw but later Ima just announce that this game is ahh and I'm leaving for good 💔✌️wish I gave 0 stars,1,2026-02-01 07:41:50
"Very Very Pay to Win. Once you get above 6000 trophies, It's like hell. It continues to get worse unless you spend money in this game. This game used to be 10/10 but now the developers somehow have managed to turn this game into absolute trash.",1,2026-02-06 23:27:49
"Great in its prime now just a cash grab, I could easily drop a paycheck on this game and be considered great. There is not another mobile game I hate more than this, the game is addicting, forces you down the ladder leaving you hardstuck until you spend some more cash, it also claims not to use deck based matchmaking even though its clear as day. The only thing they do right is trailers for the next PTW card. I can see why people wanted to move to Boom Arena.",1,2025-12-13 01:01:46
"I have been playing this game for a long time, the game is addicting, fun, and has good features. I didn't give this game a five star because the game is too pay to win.

The fact that the matching system pairs me with enemies that have higher card and tower levels than mine is disgusting. Especially happens when you won 1 to 2 matches and then the system would force you to go for a losing streak. This is no doubt a pay to win game and the system decides whether you win or lose,1,2025-12-18 13:53:29
used to love this game they keep adding stuff that makes the game more pay to win and their newest update has bugs that they don't do anything about. I've lost games due to bugs and when I report them to customer service they offer no compensation for the lost games which sucks cause you need every little bit to try and stay competitive if you don't want to drop a fortune on the game. so dumb.,1,2025-12-28 15:25:07
Newest update has squandered all the progress I worked for by introducing a new level and resetting the card counts unless I pay to upgrade. This was the last straw as it has progressively gotten worse over the last few updates and the devs are only interested in the money grab of introducing a broken card so people buy it and then nerf it into the ground next season. This cycle is anti fun and I have uninstalled.,1,2025-11-28 11:00:23
"I came back after 5 years of being away to a game that is still so p2w that if you do not splurge thousands of dollars you will be against an onslaught of decks made the same way by multiple people who also have units 2 levels higher than you because they've spent the money.... With that said, the game is not difficult. but its incredibly boring because only a few players in the game actually play the game for fun and not mindlessly spend to spam a Mega Knight. It's not fun. and needs to change.",1,2025-12-16 07:59:54
"At the core Clash Royale is an amazing game. The core trying to destroy more towers the your opponent while placing down cards that turn into troops, buildings, and spells which each cost elixir which is gradually given to you is addicting. This game can take a lot of skill with managing elixir cost and placements. Unfortunately the game is full with microtransations which has pulled many people away such as level 16, heroes, and evos. The same types of decks will appear too that will annoy you",3,2025-12-22 23:01:03
I've been playing this game for a long time.... Back in the day this game was real fun but now all this game wants is money.... Supercell's greed is killing this game and it's so pay to win now... For normal players who want to just play for fun without spending money it's so hard to climb up the ladder.... Instead of adding new cards to this game they add heroes and new evo concepts....

Supercell doesn't care about the players at all and the players don't even try to have fun with the game anymore it's the same copy paste meta decks every single game turning it into a boring soul less piece of trash.

Supercell is way too greedy. Pay to win trash. All the new game modes are garbage too. Been playing 9 years...9! Just decided to delete and stay away. Stop ruining gaming with greed. fail! Any game that doesn't let you win because you're too good is cheating. When the matchmaking is fair (rarely is) I win. but if I win 3 times it puts me against higher levels increasingly to force a loss. Don't waste your time and money.,2,2025-11-25 07:25:45
"I forget sometimes why i play this game. The game scale is wrong. You have alot of try hards and people that no life this ""phone app"" game like it's there life. its sad. I play her e and there over the years as a causal player. It, does not make me feel compelled to want to bounce back in. Some of these people have no life and it's sad.",1,2026-01-28 14:11:21
"I think there's either a problem with your game, or you guys are cheating. People are being fooled in this game. The opponent's Chompditer is getting more magic water, and it's quickly deploying more players into battle.

"This game became absolute trash. Developers only care about draining your wallet and not your in-game experience. I was upgrading my deck to level 14 for months, then I see level 15. as I made just a few cards level 15, I encounter level 16 with absolutely unfair books and elite cards to gems conversion. Now I have no resources to upgrade my cards, the deck is highly underleveled and I have to bear with lvl 36 mini pekka and a knight that absolutely destroys balance and any defense.",1,2025-12-01 17:13:03
I love the game just there is something many cheaters and hackers every time I play someone always spawn the same thing every 5 seconds it's just super annoying but other than that it's fun I just lost tons of trophies because I couldn't win against a hacker or cheater. It's a fun game it's actually extremely good And hard and I always play with my friends and family either I play duos or against each other 1 v 1,2,2025-12-02 00:00:59
this is probably one of the best mobile games you can ever get in your whole entire mobile category. this is why mobile games get a lot of credit for being good. this is like how flappy birds in angry birds used to be in their prime. so if you want a good app this is the app for you because it's fun. once again I always have to say the problem which is the pay to win part of the game yeah it's very subtle and it doesn't affect the game horribly. put once again this is my opinion,5,2025-12-08 03:09:41
"This game is massively unfair, the game purposefully makes you lose, or it is full of cheaters. Using the exact same strategy with the exact same level cards, my troops will be killed in one hit, while the cards I use barely damage who I'm playing against. I've recorded it so many times. I've watched playback where the opponent doesnt have the required elixir to summon but they do anyway, a lot. I assume its to make you think you need to pay money to advance more, it is gross.",1,2026-01-04 23:45:48
"It became way too much of a 'pay to win' type of game. Once I got past arena 12 everybody had evolution cards, whereas me I got none of them. So my only option is to spend money in order to enjoy the game. I miss the old days where this game was actually 'free'.",1,2025-12-04 00:34:18
"I have a 9 year badge. this game was great, until the update. I had almost maxed level cards. until the update. I dont even have a maxed deck. theres a severe pay wall. I have literally dedicated years for certain decks to only have the level pushed higher and to have the decks under leveled just to push the store on us. its crazy. I started a second account and it isnt easier. im not sure what they are talking about. im at 7500 trophies with level 10 cards and im facing level 14 everything. idk",1,2026-01-08 09:39:25
"Pay to win has finally peaked in the last update. Instead of having to deal with only 2 overpowered evolutions, have fun fighting 2 evos AND 2 insanely broken heroes! On top of that, there's the new card level 16. Have fun grinding for another 5 seasons to max out your deck while staying underleveled the whole time. A deck, that doesn't even work anymore because of the new op cards! Oh how delightful.

garbage game a lot of times when I search for game no matter 2v2 or 1v1 it freezing while searching for a game and I have to close the game and open it back up. when I open it back up it has me in a game with me already losing all because the game wants to freeze while searching. I have 2 other phones s25 plus and it happens on there too.,1,2025-12-25 07:51:51
"The game is very enjoyable but addictive and it makes you want to play more and more. On the whole it is very enjoyable and I very much recommend it. If you are trying to keep your screen time usage to a minimum, though, do NOT install this app. 😁 Edit: Clash screwed up with LVL 16 and Heroes. It's so P2W and not fun anymore.",4,2026-01-19 23:24:55
DEVS DON'T LISTEN TO ANY PLAYER FEEDBACK WHATSOEVER. Latest big update literally had everything that the players kept saying for years not to add. The biggest content creator quit making videos on the game because of this update. The best player in the game actively complains about the update. What have they done after hearing this feedback? THEY DOUBLED DOWN. Over half of my clan quit after a month and the remaining only talk about how bad the game is. DO NOT DOWNLOAD UNTIL IT GETS BETTER.,1,2026-01-30 11:51:01
"Terrible, absolutely terrible. The core of this game is do good for two rounds, then go on a 5-game losing streak. Whoever decided to add the feature of losing the same amount of trophies as winning, I hate you. Terrible game, annoying game, but yet so addicting.",3,2025-12-20 12:06:39
This game is corny every update makes the game more and more pay to win to the point where they added 4 characters that are only possible to get by paying 15$ each and basically guarantee a win bc they have extra power that gives you free plays worth multiple elixir its corny now the game was 1000x better and actually require thought and strategy to be good,1,2025-12-19 02:04:21
So I started WAAAAY back in 2019 or 2020 I cant remember but what I do remember was that this game.. WAS GREAT! Ok it wasn't that good but this was before evos and heroes and when it was practically dead and it wasn't that p2w imo but anywho then I take a break and over that break evos get added and they WERE SO BROKEN and guess whay the only way to get them.. was to pay 10 dollars. And then level 16. More money. Now heroes. More money. Do you see the pattern? And they are not gonna stop.,2,2025-12-30 03:21:13
"this game is terrible. it is the most unbearable pay to win game you can think of, it took me three years to get a max level deck, and then they drop this unwanted and unnecessary hero and lvl 16 update, and now I'm facing nothing but lvl 16 evo megaknight players the entire time. you can not progress without dumping money into this game. Do not install this horrible game, this greedy corporation does not deserve your money or your playtime. This is without a doubt the worst app I invested in.",1,2026-01-18 21:45:11
"Now this game is laggy. Every time you finish a game, it takes a long time to log back in. I used to really like this game, but now the problem is that it's so slow. It makes waiting so much more frustrating.",1,2025-12-24 21:46:01
The game became worse and only pay to win. you have to spend around 20k USD to compete with other who played it for a long time or bought pass royale before. the prizes if the game are not enough to progress and it became the waste of time and energy,1,2026-01-03 20:15:13
"Update: The game is the worst of all, hasn't changed at all, with all it's moronic updates, there are no means of reporting cheaters, a lot of bot (what are the odds, same deck but different names for 3 persons in a row, and same style, like ToxicIshigami for one). Also the tournament are still rigged, the one who payed the most is the champion, I don't know how esports can allow this, and ,,sudden"" disconnecttions are at about every 5 wins, as usual. Still a imbecilic worthless game.",1,2026-01-03 21:53:55
"More than half of the shop is for paying with real money to level up your cards and now even evolve them, its not even funny playing and learning when the biggest wall to surpass on this game is your wallet, I dont know why would you loose your time on playing this, check any other 5€ game without these insane microtransactions",1,2026-01-27 11:17:23
"2/2/2026 what are these developers even doing anymore. Game is extremely pay to progress. New heros are broken and don't make gameplay more exciting. How does a game take a revival and absolutely decimate it? Supercell always finds a way. Such a shame because I believed the game had a good coming back in July. :( 11/16/2021 This game was amazing until the new meta dropped. Matchmaking remains bad, keep losing connection mid game, It's too unplayable until certain mechanics are fixed or changed",1,2026-02-02 17:28:31
After every small patch update the game just can't connect to the internet for a couple of days and its super frustrating. You guys need to set up and fix these small little issues.,2,2026-02-13 20:59:46
"Honest, this game was easily 6 stars, yes, more than 5, but now, ever since evolutions got introduced, the game's quality has just continually gone down. I think heroes was their stupidest idea yet. The only ones who disagree are ptw and braindeads.",4,2026-01-02 10:27:02
"This game used to be the best but now there's just too many evos and I dont think the new champion cards are any fun either this game is just a pay to win now and when games turn into pay to win it ruins it completely it's just not fun anymore and the game just isn't fair like it used to be. I remember when it was just skill based no special stuff just good old strategy and skill now you have to pay for EVERYTHING Evos, bundles etc. supercell have gone downhill so much it's unbelievable honestly",1,2025-12-05 07:33:22
Clash in 2025 is a good game. As a new player this year I can say that as someone who is f2p Evo shards should be easier to get however it isn't too bad. the gameplay is addictive and quick meaning you can play a quick game before you do something which is good. My main issue is that there is a lot of pay to win and as I am in arena 15 I find that there are a lot of unbalanced people. I will go from playing an easy to beat player to an Evo mega knight spammer. still a great game though.,4,2025-12-03 05:11:48
"Im f2p, been maxed out level 15 for a while, and am decently good at the game, winning more than I lost. The game is so p2w after the recent level 16 + heros update. Supercell lied when they promised level 15 would be the last level increase. DO NOT PLAY, each time they release a new card its nerfed once enough people buy it. Then they add a new broken card to repeat the process, treating us like a cattle farm of mindless animals, milking us for money.",1,2025-12-23 20:44:58
"When I go to a higher arena, the shop offers get more expensive. Why do they get more expensive the higher the arena? it feels like you want us players, to spend even more money because we're in higher arenas and it feels like they want us to spend more money without realizing it, it's stupid and it should be the same price as lower arenas. You should not overcharge high rated players, just because they're good doesn't mean they're rich.",1,2025-11-28 21:56:48
"Started out as a great game, but greed has over taken the spotlight, now experience has nothing to do with it and strategy is all but non existent, sad that they allowed greed to be deciding factor!!! If it weren't for my grandson I would delete. Not sure why I still play, guess I am hoping that experience wins again, but that just seems to be a dream becoming more and more disappointing! They have done it again how can you play royal recruits , mega Knight, and executioner all within 3 seconds",1,2025-12-28 21:59:47
"the longer this game gose on the more the power creep gets out of hand, the micro transactions are obnoxious. they update with the new gimmick forcing you to dump a bunch of money into the game just to compete with the next best thing thats out. its an uphill battle fighting against the new thing that's released. then once they get enough money out of this new product, they nerf what you paid for. just wait and stop playing until nerf to hit. then, you can start actually playing the game again",2,2025-12-07 13:37:52
Game stops being fun once you reach a certain trophy count. You encounter the same 3 or 4 decks every match. The creativity is lost and not paying for the pass is punished with bad matchups. switch decks and your next opponent will have the exact cards needed to counter you. there's no subtlety to it.,1,2026-02-05 04:46:32
Horrible game. Puts you up against either higher level opponents or lower level and its rig to where once you reach a certain level you gain nothing but coins and cant even spend them. This app used to be good now everyone just runs a no skill deck its a joke to what they did to the game no wonder alot of ppl left it never coming back to it for sure till maybe they fix it to where no one runs no skill anymore and good balance changes especially mega knight worst and no skill card in the game,1,2025-11-27 14:53:17
"I grabbed this game a few months ago and spent on average $10-$20 per month to progress faster which definitely was noticeable, but with the most recent update, I just feel like I am barely making any progress after my usual spending for the month. The developers totally revamped how the rewards work and it's disgusting how greedy they have become so they can squeeze maximum profits.",1,2025-12-25 20:00:04
"I've been playing this game for over a decade, and while I've noticed minor imbalances in the past, the introduction of the 'Hero' card by Supercell has led me to believe that the game has lost its balance. For e.g., if a developer could assist me with this, how would one effectively defend against an opponent's Hog Rider attacking my Princess Tower when they have deployed a Knight (Hero) in front of it, and in the final decisive moments, the Knight has activated its 'Triumphant Taunt' ability?",1,2026-01-03 15:37:38
"This app has went downhill over the last year, the attention the game got from big streamers and influencers caused Supercell to entirely change the games basic principles, making it not only very pay to win but ruining the games enjoyable aspect, that being the variety of cars and the challenge of facing someone, the games broken cards namely the Mega Knight and Boss Bandit are so largely dominant and broken in the meta and are used by most, forcing everyone to face the same decks over and over",1,2026-02-14 20:42:30
"This game is fun..... especially once you find the key cards to have in your deck. Update 9 years later -> Game is NOT fun, its a bunch of pay to win slop, I'm getting defeated by lower king tower levels than I am who have higher troop levels because they pulled their wallets out. Recommend NOT getting it.",1,2025-12-17 21:49:05
"Clash Royale is super fun, well-animated, and satisfying when you outplay someone,but everything around the gameplay ruins it. Progress is a slow grind, pay-to-win card levels decide verymany matches, and matchmaking often feels rigged. It stops feeling like a strategy game and starts feeling like a cash grab.I’m giving it 1 star not because the gameplay is bad, but because the way the game is managed, monetized, and balanced turns something genuinely great into something that feels exploitative",1,2025-12-07 06:37:06
"Six years ago I was playing this game, then I uninstalled it because of a login problem. Now I'm playing it again, but the same problem that made me uninstall it has returned, so I uninstalled it again. It's unbelievable; the game seems to get worse with each passing year.",1,2025-12-26 02:49:21
been playing for 10+ years. The game has become filled with microtransactions. They position purchasing buttons in different locations every other week to induce misclicking and improper spending. It has become a money grab while gameplay has severely suffered.,1,2026-01-03 01:01:02
"Game is or was pretty fun, but the people behind it really don't care about it anymore. They've for a long time now purposefully and consistently worsened the game just to influence people to spend more money and do not care about how it affects the game itself, just if profits are increasing. The main reason I'm giving it a 1 star on not a two star is just because a 4.5 star rating does not at all reflect the state of the game.",1,2025-11-27 04:52:19
well here is my updated review. I would love to give this game a better review but yet again I'm having issues simply trying to log in to my lvl 60 with my Gmail account but I've been waiting for several hours and still have not received an email to recover my account.,1,2026-02-07 04:25:22
"I’ve loved this game for five years, but I’m now very disappointed. It has become heavily pay-to-win, which makes the experience frustrating for players like me who don’t spend much money. Competing against those who invest and unlock all evolutions feels unfair, and the fun is gone. I won’t quit completely, but I’ll play less because it’s no longer enjoyable.",2,2025-12-06 18:50:06
Actually unplayable. They keep adding broken cards that are pay to win and even if they didn't having your opponents straight up be 50% more effective than you because they're 5 levels above you isn't fun. Devs don't care about you in the slightest only your wallet. They won't change something unless profit is involved which even some of the most hated game studios will make atleast some changes for the sake of their players.,1,2026-01-04 05:26:45
"Really fun game and keeps me entertained at school and home. it adds a little excitement in your day by giving you daily rewards and other stuff like free events and other. And it is really fun with friends and helped me make friends with lots of people. but I don't like the game can get you fired up sometimes and make you mad. because of P2W players and other stuff. but anyways, I love this game! 😊",4,2025-12-22 03:13:46
"Completely unplayable with all the pay to win users. I was in the same arena for about a week getting matched with players of similar level. Now, everyone's the same level but have cards that are 1-2 levels above mine. Do not recommend unless you've got a couple thousand lying around.",1,2026-01-08 08:22:07
"Don't download this game unless you have money or your parents are useless. It's pay to win and each update that comes out makes it even worse. Matchmaking puts you against hard counters to your deck, and it tries to entice you to buy and buy. It is addictive and fun for a little bit then you go against someone who has a lv.16 megaknight and boss bandit which instantly ends the game basically since your either underleveld or your elxair gone. Which is much less then the opponent hour fighting!!",1,2026-01-09 03:08:31
just pllssss don't add anymore hero it's making the game not fun at all 🤬 it might be a great way to earn money but clash royale is the only game I enjoy to play at 2025 and this year. whit more heros in the game which you can control it after the placement is less skill then p2w. please reply. thank you.,2,2026-01-30 14:04:17
it used to be a decent fair playing game. Now its clearly a pay to play game. If you dont spend money you won't even be in the middle of the pack. With my regular deck and war decks I have a minimum of 40 cards. on the royal pass where you have the 90 chests you open I opened 90 of them and it gave 2 of the 40 cards I use and close to 50 percent of those chests were coins and you can't do a lot with coins except for upgrade cards and thats a long task in itself now. Supercell has turned greedy.,2,2026-01-10 02:23:33
"Greedy game that favors short-term purchases over long-term playing retention. Does not care about the player base, and manipulates players into a position to spend money. I played for 5 years, and they have ruined my desire to play",1,2025-12-18 14:38:24
"It was a fun game initially, the creators of the app have gotten obscenely greedy, and prioritize the pay 2 win aspect and keep releasing more and more pay to win aspects while ignoring balance. It is bad when you had grinder out to max level everything just to have them change the entire setup and release ""hero"" cards that can be so obscenely over powered that if 2 are played no matter what is played to counter you've lost. Balance needs MAJOR work. 1 star game now.",1,2026-02-06 02:40:57
I used to play this game a lot . but now this game is all about money . if you make purchase then you win . Because evo cards have a very good advantage and without them. ranking up is hard and the way to get those cards is only through purchase . i hate this game now bad matchmaking .,1,2025-12-27 22:49:36
DONT PLAY THIS GAME. It is extremely pay to win. Progression is terrible with new update even with getting the (overpriced) clash pass. They will not honor the rewards you save over time. I do not recommend if you are free to play. You will constantly get matched with outleveled people if you are decent at the game.,1,2025-12-29 15:31:57
"I've been playing for 3 years now and it's inane how many changes they've made to make the game harder for free to play players in that short amount of time. Added evolution cards, added two Evo slots, removed level caps from ranked ladder, weakened the store, removed books, added a higher level and now heros which are basically a new evolution",2,2025-12-03 22:41:24
"First for all the old player, they added level 16, and to top it off they added heroic. Now the heroic isn't the biggest problem here nor the level 16. The biggest problem clash Royale is facing is that they are getting money hungry. They don't even care about their player base or what their user wants. also the more updates they add just feel like they are slow in the head. But the level 16 and getting rid of the books of cards just makes it unplayable or fun to play due to adding all these.",1,2025-11-25 02:19:10
"this game was made to set you to lose, ni matter how much you upgrade or how many times you change or correct your strategies, sometimes it gives you a little taste of half Victory to give you a little taste and keep you in the game like an addict, im not happy with this game, i give two stars for its other qualities. such a total waste of time",2,2025-12-25 02:47:05
This game used to be amazing....until the greedy devs added all these hero and evolution super metas. Don't play unless you're wanting to spend a butt ton of money for evos etc....and they keep changing them so you have to keep buying... used to get the pass....no more. not to mention the matchmaking pairing you up with someone 3+ levels ahead of you with every evo or op hero😤,1,2025-12-05 21:40:30
"This game is fun and strategic at first, but it gets frustrating after 5,000 trophies. You often face ""Mega Knight"" players and people who pay to win, making matches feel unfair. It is annoying when over-leveled players win without skill and act toxic. I wish that this game would add a moderation that has limitations for levels in for each arena so it wouldn't be too unfair for free to play players .",3,2025-12-29 23:02:01
Game is P2W. Matchmaking is also really bad. Matchmaking just feels rigged. Getting to level 15 was hard enough but now I need to worry about level 16? I tolerated this for so long and kept quiet. But it seems Supercell became more greedy. F2P players are struggling and these updates do not help in the slightest for F2P progression. A player is practically forced to buy from the shop with real currency to have any impactful progression. I have many more complaints but I can't write any more.,1,2026-01-26 03:18:54
"Overall the game is fine. but sometimes I am very close to winning more crowns than opponent, because towards end, it's time crunch, and if I have damaged the opponent's base quite a lot, Its still a loss. If they add a better game analysis, then losing by just 3-5sec towards the end, should not be a loss. Let's say, if I need 8sec more to kill the opponent's base, but I only have 5sec, and only 1base killed. and the opponent has 2 of my bases killed, but as I don't get 2sec more, they win. See!",3,2025-12-27 21:30:17
"honestly a fun game but with the addition of hero's I'm starting to question if supercell care more about the state of the game or making money. it truly pains me to see people leave the community but I can't blame them. this game means to much to me to quit though, even in the worst moments I was still having fun, and will for probably the rest of my life. gracias supercell",4,2025-12-28 13:20:44
This game is genuinely so unbalanced currently that it can be so difficult to play without spending a lot of real life money. Mainly with the evo witch and mega knight doing way too much damage and attacking too fast causing a lot of the main cards that are supposed to counter them not work.,1,2025-12-02 04:29:06
probably the worst game ever created. poor aspects. only the people that have no lifes and spend money on cellphone games can really get anywhere. as soon as you get to 10 000 trophies they make you have to perchance players and cards. like why do that? the matchmaking is absolutely Bazar. and the amount of cheaters hacking daily... its worst than gta 5. very poor quality game. get ready to only play for a month to get to 10 000 trophies till they match you with people that have been ranked down,1,2026-01-26 11:11:54
"Terrible Greed and Pay-to-Win. I've been a dedicated Clash Royale player for nearly a decade, but the company's greed has completely ruined it. They're constantly removing or decreasing game rewards, making it a blatant pay-to-win experience.

The constant predatory tactics are unacceptable.",1,2026-01-03 14:19:29

"awful game progression, rewarding system, buggy gameplay, uses AI Art, bad user interface, bad optimisation in PC version, high loading times in IOS version, predatory selling schemes and behaviors, Devs never listen to player feedback, and making bad balance changes every season (ignoring the elephants in the room)",1,2025-11-24 20:01:03
This game was cool. I am a active player in this but the latest updates have felt like a kick in the nuts. level 16 just seems not needed and kinda cash grabby. The game is also VERY pay to win with every match feeling like who can spend the most money. I wish that you will add a bunch of much needed balance changes ESPECIALLY WITH MEGA KNIGHT. The game is overall good but I think its steering into the wrong direction with all the new features. I suggest focusing on already existing fetures.,2,2025-12-08 03:00:08
"I don't understand why there is not a level cap per arena? Why must I, level 12 with level 12 cards face people with lvl 15 cards. It also doesn't help that the progression is so slow, literally the best way to level your cards to the bare minimum is spending money. I am a returning player but clearly the quality has fallen greatly",1,2026-01-28 14:36:18
My clan has fallen under attack by a specific player who continues to join the clan to sexually harass me and threaten other players. Despite multiple reports nothing has been done and support was useless unhelpful and cold. They only gave generic responses telling us to report him and despite saying we already have they continued to ignore me and eventually closed the ticket without doing anything to resolve the matter. It's disgusting how little they care about the safety of their player base.,1,2026-01-04 23:05:56
"Do NOT spend any money on this game. It will NEVER be enough especially with this new update where they added even more levels and now our cards are useless against the people who spend their paycheck on this game. The money you spend now on this game will mean nothing later on. Take it from someone who spent a good amount of money on this dumb game. This recent update with ""Heroes"" was the final nail in the coffin for me and I uninstall along with a ton of other players who agree.",1,2025-12-07 07:28:33
Clash Royale is 100% Rigged. Specifically merge tactics. It's very frustrating that I deleted this game. Don't waste your time like I did. You can't level up after a certain point. It's not base off skills.,1,2026-01-31 15:44:58
"The game is awesome, but I’m facing serious network issues during battles. The game frequently freezes and shows a “Network connection lost” message. The Wi-Fi symbol appears, and the game stops responding. Due to this, I’ve lost many battles unfairly.",2,2025-12-25 22:23:08
"the new heroes update is pay to win. from my experience hero chests give on average ~5 points, 200 is needed for a random hero and you get 5 chests per season. heroes are a direct upgrade to cards that unlike evolutions is always active so having one gives an advantage over anyone who doesn't because your card is just straight up better than theirs now. it might take years to get the hero you want though since it's ~8 seasons for one random hero and if you dont get the one you want tough luck",1,2026-01-11 05:03:46
This game is trash I actually spent money on it and for some reason 43 games in a row I play a certain deck and then all of a sudden there's a counter for every deck I play don't get this game it sucks your wallet dry and it's so awful and time consuming and the sad part is I'm going to keep playing because I'm that addicted and they're probably going to push this comment down,1,2026-01-08 12:11:53
"Fun game a lot of action and thinking and easy way to kill time, but pay to win and it's annoying playing against an overleveled players and the heroes not even worth talking about so hard to get for little value. All supercell really wants is to drain all of the money from you're wallet and they make the game worse.",2,2025-12-20 01:27:24
"Great game. What is this Echo update? One of the most unfair things I've ever seen added to the ""Merge Tactics"" game mode. Also, making games ""Pay to Win"" is so lazy. I remember working for cards and skill. Old Clash Royale was great and I just hope they listen to the community.",2,2026-01-25 15:07:31
"merge tactics is the absolute worst thing made, absolute scam every single game is rigged its 10% positioning and proper combination and 90% luck that you will get copies and good team, the card pool is rigged in one players favor every time same as the tile buffs placement... the winner usually has all the 3-4 star troops while the rest have only 1-2 star just cuz the game feeds one player and for others the last essential troop needed to complete your troops combination just doesn't exist !",1,2026-02-07 14:05:20
I have already had a problem with lucky drops even when they were announced in 2023. but they turned into a nothing burger of a loot drop. you can't get anything good from a 4 or 5 star anymore because of the updated rng. just make the lucky chests pull more than 1 item if it's a 4 or 5 star and everyone is gonna love the game again,2,2026-01-14 04:35:45
"This last update was really the make or break of how this game will turn out. After what they did for level 16 really made it break, they made it really p2w even more than what they had been doing with evos. On top of that, they are punishing players that were not hoarding cards and not upgrading and making it harder to max out by not reimbursing the new card upgrade amount.",1,2025-11-26 06:25:00
"NEW PLAYER Do Not install this game unless you are going to spend huge money catching up. New updates have made the game pay to win. You have been warned! Not a new player, bad news also. Lots of cards to max. Got a maxed card. You will get it again in your higher chests, again and again, improbably often and you will get star tokens to give you cosmetics. Very Poor update.",1,2025-12-13 04:41:38
"The Game Has Improved but definitely majorly shifted. Heroes are weird, but a nice take on Champions, but dont forget to add standalone Champions again too. Imo yall need to do a major drop, but in a game mode. Advertise yourselves to us/the actual players, before the updates and make the proper changes before ladder/pro implementation. also why is there not 3 prestige for most cards, or multiple decks for Lvl11 1v1s?",3,2026-01-09 15:31:21
"Game is entirely pay to win. You no longer need skill to play the game and all you have to do is put your parents credit card in. The game used to be fun where everyone could get the things that they needed without getting a pass. devs don't do anything. don't listen to the community. the balancing is awful. all together awful game for free to play players. don't play the game, it's not worth your time and the economy was far beyond ruined. good job supercell you absolute failures",1,2025-12-29 00:55:13
"Clash royale is a game that was fun at first but it gets boring after getting past about 2k trophies, once you get there, the game is mostly ""hey insert your credit card here to win"" especially with the ability to buy evolutions. another problem is the fact that over levelling isn't hard. You'll find yourself playing against opponents who are like 1-2 Tower Levels higher than you and have cards that are 1-4 times higher as well. overall: fun game, needs work on levelling, less p2w options.",2,2025-11-24 15:34:00
"Clash Royale has the worst matchmaking I have ever seen in a mobile game. In Clan Wars, about 90% of my matches are against players with cards four levels higher than mine. That is not “competitive”, it is broken. I have been playing for months and months, upgrading slowly, learning decks, putting in the time, and it still throws me into completely unwinnable matches. Skill barely matters when your opponent’s cards melt yours just because they paid more and devs can't get matchmaking fixed.",1,2026-01-25 14:39:57
"Absolutely money grabbing updates, played since before the dark prince was even a card, still play like a half an hour a day, just to get blown up by some guy playing PAID cards, if you think I'm hating whatever, but please do yourself a favor and look at recent POSITIVE reviews because they are ALL left by bots or 5 year Olds with no explanation. Without those reviews this game is 3.0/5 at the best.",1,2026-01-09 09:16:26
"Disgusting P2W. The new heroes are completely overpowered, with no counter for any of them. They removed the best free to play item (book of cards) and replaced it with the option to use gems. They also give no way to grind said gems. The only way to progress is to pay. Play Balatro instead.",1,2025-12-09 23:47:39
"absolutely horrible game, absolutelypay to win, it's full to the brim with cheaters and hackers, doing things that cant be possible without an elixir tower or 2, playing 2 7 cost units back to back with barely any time in between, never ay this game if you want a fair game",1,2025-12-29 08:12:56
"Updating my review to reflect the current state of this game. This game is even worse than it was 5 years ago. This game is heavily oriented towards Pay-to-Win, which means you must contribute a significant amount of money to have any considerable competitive fairness due to Evos and Heroes. In other modes, such as Merge Tactics, you must pay $20 per leader, or earn then through rigorous grinding, and these leaders offer unfair advantages. Would give 0/5 if it were possible.",1,2025-12-14 23:34:58
Today was my last matches. I've been trying to get to 9000 crowns for the past 3 weeks and everytime I get close I lose multiple matches in a row. I refuse to run a meta deck and get punished through crapping match making for it. This game could be truly something special if it wasn't just focused around pros and streamers.,1,2026-01-28 06:59:45
"Similar to gambling. Played against level 16 Mega nuts with my level 13 tower&cards, after that I faced level 14 to level 15 players . If you win too much you'll get humbled with the unfair matchmaking system, same If you lose too much you'll get computer/bot opponents. They make you face the cards that counters yours for about 5 times in a row making you regret your life choices. You would need a stable WiFi signal if you don't want to see your phone flying across the porch. Overall Good Game.",4,2026-01-17 17:52:57
"They're adding more and more Cash Grabs for poor kids who believe that they can get an advantage by spending money. It's a total money pit if you go down the rabbit hole. Plus, more and more Supercell bots, they should be marked as such.",1,2026-02-10 12:55:23

This game is hacked. I recently installed this game because chinese players have totally hacked the game and developers are defenceless against this hacking. I have been playing this game for more than 9 years but now whenever I am winning the game sudden internet issues pop up and I lose. I am getting 1080 p streaming on YouTube at the same spot. some dirty players have switched to this disrupt your opponent connection when you're losing tactics. no point in playing further,1,2026-02-02 04:37:50

"Really good boredom, buster. Once you get further into the game, you get a lot more interesting cards, allowing you to have a better time. There are no ads.

Like I cannot que into a game without someone having a lvl 14 hog rider. I think adding a lvl cap for cards in each arena would be best, as it will limit the pay to wins from making the game unplayable.

"The level 16 update is the worst thing Supercell has done. The reason is the difficulty of getting cards, while there's a dedicated gold chest. Why do they give me gold in the Lucky Drop? I need cards to spend the 5 million gold I have, which is the maximum gold limit in the game. I don't benefit; I just waste time when they give me gold that's already full.

Balance can be an issue, especially since developers can be reluctant to nerf cards that just came out, but i can live with that.

I would rather have a longer wait time then get level 14s and 15s every game. so stupid. im only level 11. the level gap in this game is trash.,1,2025-12-19 00:20:20
Been playing since 2016. As soon as this game hit their all time high they got greedy and made lv 16 and heroes. Everyone hated it and supercell doubled down with more heroes on the way. They don't care about their players only making a quick buck. I used to constantly make ultimate champion each season but now get your credit card ready if you expect to make any progress in this game,1,2026-01-03 11:26:36
"Card Convert to Crystals..... This is not Good decision... One of the worse decision for players... it better to give choice to convert the Gold/Gems into Crystals but crystals can not compensate cards. Cards are the main part of game and Emojis are useless. Secondly, Gold is wasting.... Too much Gold.... after getting 5 Million Gold it wasted... Convert this into something like cards or something good...",1,2026-01-23 09:00:38

Game is terrible been playing since it started and its just pay to win now. The other problem thats ran into consistently is people using elixir cheats to spam overwhelming amounts and it only seems to get worse . The only reason I even got back on this heep of a game was because chaos battle league got shut down. Highly regret coming back,2,2026-01-29 14:44:37

"This update is just a straight-up money grab. They removed almost every way to upgrade cards, but added upgrades for crystals instead.

"level 16 and new heros. why would they add this. they killed their own game, most people hadn't even got 1 level 15 now you add level 16 which all the people that are bad will buy it because all the company do is care about money so they will make players spend thousands just to win. because playing the game free to play is pointless because it would take a lifetime to max everything",1,2026-01-21 18:47:09

"Clash Royale is a really fun and strategic game that keeps me hooked every time I play. It’s not just about dropping cards randomly – you have to think carefully about timing, placement, and how to counter your opponent’s moves. I like how every battle feels different, and there are so many decks and strategies you can try. The game is fast-paced, exciting, and rewarding, which makes it one of the best mobile games I’ve played.",5,2025-08-22 04:29:43
"honestly this game is great, I have been playing it for some years now and have had only one problem with it. My biggest problem with this game is that its way too easy for me✌️. I got all the way to 10,000 trophies in a month with only a couple of losses. Overall fun game until you become the goat like me and never lose. If I had to compare my skill to something I would say that im like saitama when it comes to clash royale way too strong/good for anyone else to beat me🤴😂.",3,2026-01-04 16:08:18

"it is so frustrating that this stupid game just makes it impossible to outskill oponents. I'm currently at lvl 11 at Arena 21. I upgraded every card possible to get the highest level. In game, I always face a lvl 13-14 opponent. So I have to do 1k extra damage per tower just to make it equal and also their towers do much more damage than mine. It completely changes the interactions and makes my tower basically useless.",1,2025-12-22 08:55:58
"the new update is not it, the game was already pay to win and adding level 16 to the game and removing wild cards and using gems to upgrade is the worst idea you guys did.

honestly not a bad game its just pay to win for most of it and if your opponent spends money basically impossible to win and the balancing doesnt really exist and overall just annoying to play once you hit higher arenas and the gold shop takes a day to reload and its just sucks half the time honestly I had to change it to a 1 cause its worse then I thought at first,1,2026-01-30 14:07:12
I have been playing clash Royale for 3 years and I finally had 5 of the 8 cards in my main deck maxed after YEARS of upgrading. then they came out with level 16 and now almost all of my matches are against players with higher level cards AND towers so almost every game I start off with 400 less heath on my towers than my opponents. they are clearly money hungry and don't care about any of the player base.,1,2025-12-31 15:43:02

"very fun game, although sometimes balanced in my opinion these new heros shouldn't be released and immediately be able to be bought. All content about clash royale i see is people gemming there way to level 16 cards which makes the game sometimes unplayable. since i want ed to keep playing the game I had to influence the bad parts and purchase some things to boost me to get a little bit closer to being fair gameplay 😭✌️. this does not help at all for the F2P community. lets get this noticed 🫰",5,2026-01-20 13:32:40

When you get to the first few arenas you think that it's fun and all but it really isn't. Supercell has ruined a fun game with pay to win. There is no good reason why a level 16 Megaknight should be in arena 16. Supercell has gotten so money hungry that they don't even want to make it fair for people who are free to play. I do not recommend this game.,2,2026-01-03 02:12:04
"Loved this game but this new season is just bad, plus now the game keeps crashing. It just shows a lack of care.

Every match is a new chance to refine strategy, adjust decks, and adapt to different opponents. The evolving meta and constant updates keep the game fresh and challenging.

When I started 5 years ago this game was great and fun. A few months ago they made changes that affected the season rewards that I paid and played for with no compensation. Today I found out that other more valuable card items that I paid for are now gone. This is disrespectful and bad business. I've never played a game that disrespects peoples money in this way. The first time I was mildly annoyed but now this game doesnt get my time or energy.,1,2025-11-30 10:15:21
"Seems recently that the connectivity has been in and out. I've lost connection in the middle of a battle several times with perfect 5g service.

I've come very close to deleting a few times as it seems that a few troops have been buffed and are way overpowered now too. I might also add that there has been a increase in toxicity. Overall, im very annoyed with it",1,2025-12-29 12:39:40

"if I could put lower I would, this game used to be super fun until they added the stupid mechanic where they try to give everyone a 50% win rate. it's dumb and it makes you feel like this game is against you. anytime you go on a winning streak the game automatically puts you up against a hard counter to your most valuable card. likewise if you're on a losing streak it puts you against a really good matchup for your most utilized card. this game is stupid don't play it.",1,2026-01-16 03:29:31
"I’m tired of these chest-opening animations and being forced to tap the screen. Clash Royale has a long-term, mature player base. We play to actually play, not to spend minutes opening chests with forced taps. It feels more like boosting engagement metrics than real gameplay. You should prioritize matches, not waste players’ time. If this keeps getting worse, people will leave out of frustration. Add an option to skip or disable chest-opening effects so we can focus on gameplay.",3,2026-01-15 23:16:22
Supercell has ruined the game by adding champions and level 16.

I love clash Royale I have played since 2022 and it is still one of my favorite games. they also added one of my favorite game modes into clash Royale. Merge tactics which just got a really fun update(you can also unlock mega knight).but the reason why I didn't give a 5 star review was because the game's new update is not my favorite. They just added heroes and level 16 into the game which I don't like and I think heroes should have been a limited time event instead of being permanent like evos.,4,2025-12-04 00:59:48

was a great game at release. the development team has massively failed long term and free to play players. with all the new evo troops and now heros being added its just a money grab because you can not play at a competitive level without the new strongest whatever it is that month and you cant get it without paying. every update worse than the last. speaking from 9 years wasted on this game- play something else. This game has become nothing more than massive pay to win trash.,1,2025-12-17 03:37:36
"This is an absolutely horrible game based on what you need to ""be good."" The entirety of the game is just paying more money for stronger cards. Most matches I play involve an over leveled opponent who has cards that are way too strong for the current place that I'm at. There are also unnecessary additions being constantly added to the game that makes it even more unfair. There's such a paying aspect to it that it gets to a point where you're just stuck at one place and cannot advance.",1,2025-11-25 04:40:41

Newest update proceeded to expel any books you have. I was planning on using an epic book of cards on my skeleton army when it upgraded to level 13.

"I can't begin to describe how much I despise the new update, I can't go into a match without my opponent have an overleveled win condition and/or overleveled king tower it's so Infuriating to go against and there was no reason to add heroes to this game when it already has evolutions and champions, they are draining free to play players of their gold to even have a chance at getting to a decent trophy count",2,2025-12-03 04:57:01
"Turned to cash grab.. Has good gameplay, but they made evo cards for a select few cards and are now dropping hero cards... Didn't even give evos to the cards they still had but released a new pay to win card.

I also used to play Clash of Clans. My Town Hall is max",1,2025-12-08 00:56:31
A game with good mechanics that's sadly been neglected. Userbase is declining and gameplay is stagnant due to few substantial updates. If Supercell would lavish the same attention on Clash Royale as Brawl Stars then it would still be thriving and worth recommending. Update 10/01/26: The developers have added overpowered Heroes which rely on a gacha gambling system to unlock. Merge Tactics is the only mode worth playing until they ruin that as well.,1,2026-01-10 14:31:01

wish I could give it a 0 but I can't. I'm done with this game because I all they do is jam special offers down your throat and all they want is money form evos to heros to pass royal they make every thing stupidly over powered and once they make a lot of money on it they nerf it to the ground and it makes the game terrible for free to play players like me and many others.

"This game is a mess, to put it nicely. Every single update since the last ~year was thought up by a team motivated by the sole incentive of getting people to spend as much money as possible. Every evolution is stronger than the last so people spend money on it to keep up. The buying power of gems keeps going down, but their price stays the same. I dare you to try and think of a different reason for why they would add Level 16 cards.",1,2025-11-24 21:46:47
P2P rubbish now the meta constantly shifts but no one can keep up without paying every update. this game used to be a gem I've played for 9 years and they have really screwed this game the addition of evos and now heroes was where this game fell off cause they were locked behind a paywall. I have a level 70 acc have spent $1000 on this game and won't even buy pass royale now I can't fund this gate kept experience any longer I stand with the F2P players 😤 the og player base is dying.,1,2026-01-01 21:23:14
used to be a great game. Now in order to have a deck that you can even compete with. You must have evo level 16 cards. Only actual way of getting that is to pay a bunch of money which I won't ever do. Along with now paying more money to get golden level cards. Horrible game now.,1,2025-12-09 07:48:15
"Wish I could give 0, My childhood game I've been playing for years destroyed by greed and negligance, All Supercell wants is money now and no care for the community and I wish they realise their game has become pay to win on so many levels it's insane, Would not recommend reinstalling or downloading until they fix the way to win and unfair updates and aspect of the game",1,2026-01-20 23:25:55
"The heroes update sucks. Heroes are a ridiculous addition to the normal gameplay. It’s pointless to play against them. Once a hero is played you know you've lost. Heroes are overpowered and block you from dropping your own cards on your own side of the board. If Heroes had their own game style, it would be a different story. On top of that when the heroes update released, all my decks across all game types were deleted. all the elite cards I was saving became useless, not fairly compensated.",1,2025-12-27 13:37:30

"great game with fun lobbies and addictive, fast-paced games, but one thing I would say is the progression could be slightly more rewarding, aswell as being easier to progress. aswell as this, you can get like 80% of the cards from paying, and F2P players get destroyed by P2W players.",4,2025-11-26 02:21:20
"Great and addictive game with strategic play and it is very fun. Until you start progressing to more arenas. Overpowered cards (like Mega knight) and broken cards (like boss bandit) are super annoying to face, especially because this game is also very pay to win. Evolutions are very very hard to get since it takes 3-4 months for 6 shards. Pass royale players get them easily and are a nightmare to defend. I suggest nerfing Mega knight hitpoints, Boss bandit, Prince's damage and just broken cards",3,2025-11-24 21:47:47

Pretty frusterated.",1,2025-12-09 14:04:32

The major problem I have with it is that there's a few balancing issues, specifically with the Evolutions and, more specifically, the Evo witch. in my opinion, she's slightly too overpowered, and honestly, the witch didn't really need an Evo, it started out as giving underutilised cards a big buff to giving already good meta cards an even bigger buff and making the game way more infuriating. and Supercell doesn't listen to its f2p playerbase anymore.",2,2025-12-06 04:12:53

They add new levels and completely unbalanced powerful cards only to nerf them the second their is a new overpowered card (of course you will need to pay money to have a reasonable chance of playing with these cards at a high level),1,2025-11-25 19:51:56

Do not support these devs.",1,2025-12-21 02:19:23

was a great game then they kept updating it so any time or work is just lost. they keep changing it to make the people who pay go straight to the top. nothing to do with how long you've played or grinded don't waste your time unless you plan on waisting money too.,1,2025-11-25 11:40:10

It's unbelievable how greedy it is, algorithm matchmaking so you have less chances of winning so you are forced to pay money, new update made it even more pay to win, not to mention the LVL of players that go against you that are much higher extremely higher with troops 3-4 lvls above, do not play this game. I repeat do not.",1,2025-11-27 04:39:05

this game is getting worser and worser each update. after the hero update whenever I start playing there is some guy who is very overleveled and I can't do anything about it. People can just buy their levels using gems which makes no sense at all since u can buy gems easily using irl money. this game is very p2w and it only thing keeping it alive is the gameplay which is getting worser anyways. I hope this game dies out,1,2025-12-08 01:11:04

Played this game since launch just been a down hill roller-coaster. Issues I have dealt with: 1. Pay to win- No matter if you grind or play consistently they will screw you over with the monthly updates that release absurdly op cards then nerf them which is a serious issue. 2. match making- honestly horrible 3. current hero slots just really ruined the game 4. lvl 16- The dev team explicitly said no lvl 15 if I recall correctly and we are at 16😶 Would list more but... No space.,1,2025-12-22 16:16:38
this game is a unbalanced mess yes it would be a fun game if only it was fair! a game like this shoulnt have a lvl up system at all it messes up everything if ur card is a lvl lower. interactions that should of been easy to deal with u have to overcommit to which makes u lose. either they make it so u dont go against people who have their cards at almost the max lvl while ur stuck at lvl 10 or 11 or just delete the whole level mechanic as a whole. be better,1,2026-01-14 12:59:26

"this game has become all about who pays the most money , years of play and they update to a level 16 , lower your cards and make it impossible to play and level up unless you have years , so they use addictive traits and have kids stealing there parents credit cards to level 1 card up. the value is nowhere near the price in this game",1,2026-01-09 05:32:09
"The worst game I have ever played in my life. Every time I open the game I lose a part of my soul. Why would you add a level system to trophy road, which should only be dependent on the skill of the player and not how much money can the players throw at upgrading cards to line the pigs at supercells pockets? Trophy road should have equal levels so that you ascend and descend based upon how well you perform, and not because someone can afford to drop a level 15 Evo mega knight on your head.",1,2025-11-26 10:42:12
The game is fun for the first couple of thousand trophies but after that It is constant grind and money wanting. But as a F2P Who has hit 10k it was fun for a while but with the constant updates that break the game it's still a good game but you have to be patient.,3,2025-11-30 01:40:13
"As a Clash veteran I can say that this company (Supercell) is the most disgusting game developing company in the world. Besides the fact that this game is a casino in disguise, the developers don't respect their community by a single bit. The game is very addicting but unbalanced to the point where you have to spend minimum of 300$ to max 1 deck and enjoy the game to its full potential. I am usually a very chill person and want no harm to anybody but I seriously hope for this company's downfall.",1,2025-12-28 04:31:22

The idea behind this game is great. And the game in general would also be great if not for one thing... This game is extremely P2W. It is so P2W to the point where you can win effortlessly if you spend enough money. Progression for F2P players is extremely bad. As a F2P player you would need more than a year to get one card to the max level which would be okay if not for the fact that you could do the same thing in a day by spending money. Matchmaking is also bad and the game is very unbalanced.,3,2025-12-22 03:05:19

But it's very addictive and can be there for hours, so play and start grinding now!",5,2025-12-06 11:35:11
to all new players unless you are willing to drop loads of money you wont have fun. game is very not free to play friendly. if they want to fix this game they need to make a matching making where you dont play a bunch of people who spend money when you dont super unbalanced and not fun,1,2025-11-26 10:22:29
New update got rid of my books that I had been saving for awhile and just gave me some wild blue cards like that will suffice. This game has become so money hungry people don't even need skill anymore its just about having a mega knight or whatever other broken card that you can buy with money and its annoying. Deleted because of this.,1,2025-11-26 09:02:59

Increasingly becoming pay to win. Every new feature or card they release tends to be extremely op while being solely or mostly available to people who blow money monthly on the game.

Absolutely butchered my love for the game . Im a long time player and I even spent some money on the game but honestly supercell u haven't learned a single thing about ur fan base throughout the years and yall are only cash grabbing at this point . Haven't we learned from lvl 15 now we are adding lvl 16 ? U clearly have made the game less desirable as always i quit after 9 years and its freeing to never have to grind ever again specially within a game that doesnt care about its community .,1,2026-01-14 19:24:25

"Note to Supercell: NOBODY EVER WANTS A HIGHER MAXIMUM LEVEL. This most recent update is another shameful cash grab, forcing players who want to remain competitive to pour money into the game to level up their cards or once again face max lvl decks. The ONLY TIME this game is fair is when you reach the top arenas and you all have your deck max lvl. Any other instance, you are at a disadvantage if you are a good F2P player on your way up.

The constant removal of f2p friendly features such as the seasonal shop and magic books as well as the introduction of the new level 16 after the developers already stated that they were not going to add new levels is quite infuriating.

"A honest Review and improvment. Clash Royale can be fun, but the progression is frustrating for free-to-play players. You reach a new arena by playing well, then face opponents 1–2 levels higher with Evolutions. Skill matters less than card levels, so you get stuck. I tried Classic mode for fair matches, but opponents often have two Evolutions while I have none as F2P. Classic should unlock all cards and Evolutions to be truly balanced. Or kick out Evos in classic because it's called CLASSIC",3,2025-12-16 21:44:30

"great game, fun to play, really exciting and you always want to climb to the top, but too much pay to win player, money is ruining the game",4,2026-02-07 23:59:17
"It is to pay to win, heroes and level 16 just ruined the game. Supercell, you have to fix it. They are just greedy game developers.",1,2026-02-04 23:15:03
The game is to unbalanced now. Its more frustrating than fun. Don't waste your time downloading it. Why stress yourself.,1,2026-02-01 07:01:56
"very fun, has a great progression system, lots of cards and game modes too, the seasonal events are fun to!",5,2026-02-08 01:50:58
very hard to make progress with out buying the pass. After the last update most of the awards for playing are now decorations.,1,2026-01-31 01:49:15
"What is the probability of just getting a card? I'm in arena 14 and legit, for the past 4 arenas and from the chest in the BP, I've only been getting coins. Specifically only 1400 and 6000 coins. And I've only been getting 1 star or 2 star chest in the same period. If I'm lucky it'll be 3 stars but I know it'll only be more coins. I haven't gotten a single character card from a chest for a while already and I'm tired of only getting coins. Fix these drop rates cause it's making the game painful",1,2026-02-02 18:51:58
"Edit 2026 The amount of in game distractions have doubled since '24. Nobody plays offensive, only the same maybe 10 defensive cards. Definitely used to be more fun.",2,2026-02-07 08:30:30
great game if you want to play online and battle! it's so much fun to make clans with your family and friends! highly recommend this game if you love strategic pvp and funny matches! (JESUS LOVES YALL)✝️🙏🫶✌️🙌,5,2026-02-14 08:53:55
"Ive played this gave over a decade, I actually started a clan, and I've introduced quite a few friends to it. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!",5,2026-01-31 17:02:25
"I love clash royale,the only problem is that its p2w but its still a great concept and if you grind it hard enough will override the overleveled players.So in conclusion skill is the most important of clash,that's why we clash.",5,2026-02-02 08:44:52
"this game is going downhill without breaks. all units, evolutions and heros can be repeated meaning that this game has returned to those gacha practices that made it drop to death in the past",1,2026-02-02 03:16:42
"absolute trash and unbalanced game, terrible ideas of spending money and overall terrible updates and community, I can't even remember the last time this game was balanced and fun",1,2026-02-08 00:33:22
"This game is good all around. I enjoy playing with my friends. I don,t put money on the game. I am in arena 13 right now. and my clan is ,"" i like pickles"" if you want too join. 5 stars.",5,2026-02-05 09:08:13
unbalanced and unfun. was good while it lasted. heavily pay to win and magically some players just have infinite elixir. This game will never be good again,1,2026-02-01 04:30:55
I logged in today and found my WHOLE account just disappeared I was in arena 20 and had to restart all of my hard work it might be a bug but I don't know.,1,2026-02-06 06:09:44
I thought this game was the nuts until my esperiance got bad when I got to a stage where I was 39 points away from the next stage going to 139 points from the next stage if that is fair play then I'm very disappointed,1,2026-02-13 06:36:28
"Level 16? Seriously? I don't even know why Supercell thought it was a good idea to add it in. It just makes the game more unfair and grindy for people who don't want to spend money on the game. And to add salt to the wound, card slots like evolution cards and the newly added hero cards greatly affect the game in a negative aspect by forcing a deck to put in at least two cards that have evolutions or hero versions of them. I also hope that Supercell isn't using generative AI for the newer updates",1,2025-12-07 06:27:39
"I'm on the loading page for 23 mins (multiple refresh) it’s stuck in 100%. and it’s not the first time, nor my internet is weak",1,2026-02-05 18:13:12
"its completely pay to win its ok in the beginning but once you reach mid latter its just hell not because people are better than you. But because they have better stuff than you, because they bought.",1,2026-02-06 04:42:10
"I've played this game for years and it's sad to see it go towards the pay to win side of games, I recently stopped playing and supporting this game because of it.",1,2026-02-11 05:40:06
absolute trash. the devs are allergic to having fans of the game. I just lost my 100th game in a row to an overleveled mega knight and the game had the audacity to ask if I'm enjoying myself.,1,2026-02-01 13:10:53
"Used to be a really good game and they very heavily made it pay to win, give 0 credit to anyone besides themselves, are a selfish company who need to change.",1,2026-02-11 21:11:51
There's no doubt that clash royale is one of the top rated mobile games. It has amazing graphics and display. I enjoy this game with full zeal. ❤️❤️❤️,5,2026-02-05 12:57:38
Jynxi revived the game. You guys killed it in less than a year. and didnt attribute any of it to him. worst state this game has ever been in. very sorry I gave you money,1,2026-02-14 09:14:25
horribly buggy with most matches force quitting you. Winning feels like nothing as the next opponent will always have some kind of over buffed card. Pass royale ruins the overall experience due to it going an in game advantage. Winning gives you 30 trophies losing takes 60. Horrible experience.,1,2026-02-15 05:53:08
"The game's new concept is so annoying , heroes , level 16 , new cards etc etc. , it's not about skill now , it's about how higher cads and heroes you have ....terrible supercell",1,2026-02-08 04:19:04
game is fun apart from the pay to win and mega knight spam. if you have money the game is good otherwise you will just have a frustrating time,3,2026-02-12 12:38:46
"There is much tactics and skill with strategy, but there's like a 1/200 is a P2W. I like it because it is great graphic",4,2026-02-01 19:44:08
"Previously great game has been made ""PAY TO PROGRESS!"", a shamefull money grab from kids. Pitty I couldn't give zero stars, don't load unless you want to lose money!!!!!",1,2026-02-10 14:03:22
I've had this game for a long time and ive always enjoyed playing it but what is wrong with you your thought process is hey look at that there getting some where after a long time of work let's ruin there day with 18 over leveled players pay to win players and toxic players I've never been more mad that people like you think that's funny add some level restrictions for arenas nobody likes you guys anymore because you just tell people that there hard work is rewarded with this BS,1,2025-12-16 07:18:30
"Pay to win ruined the format of this game. Even if that wasn't enough, they added heroes which are way worse than what you would expect. Even if that wasn't enough, they reduce the value of troops we used to get from lucky drops. Even if that wasn't enough, these greedycell instead of listening to the community, made the game so unbalanced that you can't win anymore unless u spend money on this game. For your mental health, stay away from this game",1,2026-01-12 21:59:12
"The more updates there are, the more it's not right, the 2 vs 2 matchmaking is unbalanced. How come I keep getting a stupid team and keep leaving the match and when I leave the match it gets suspended for more than 50 minutes? This made me lose in a row and I couldn't run away",1,2026-01-25 16:45:46
"Android players are at a disadvantage when you play against iPhone players. The timing of plays and resolution of latency is always in the iPhone players advantage. If you are just learning android is fine but when you get good, iPhone is the only fair version.",4,2025-12-04 02:06:23
they need to add tutorial videos or better random decks because most of the random decks are the worst like why would they not put a mini pekka? but this game is very addicting (this is a warning) but can be very fun if you just play something else then crown road if you rage a lot but a solid four stars :),4,2026-01-08 02:58:51
it's been 8 years that i play this game and nothing is make for free to play players while we are part of the majority. This game still the best mobile game ever but create for pay to win players and it is poorly balanced you can do better suppercell your game is just incredible.,4,2026-01-30 06:17:33
"Game is good, I would like the sides to be balanced with not playing against players who have higher level cards for example ( my highest card is 11 and I'm playing against level 13 stacked deck, like come on, how!?.) anyways also it sometime just won't even let me open the app until I uninstall and reinstall, really annoying.",4,2025-12-05 22:23:54
"This game is honest trash, kind of trash that isn't even recyclable. Every time i play my game just randomly lags and makes me lose trophies, mind you i pay for 5 instead of 2.5hz WiFi. The game is also pay to win as a cheery on top.",1,2026-01-22 11:42:48
"This game has not even finished one gimmick(evolutions, gold skins, champions, shops, game modes) and is already puting another down the pipeline. The game also has a currency(gold stars) that has no use much like when they add a new level to cards. The game has some entertainment but is a corporate game experience with little thought towards the community opinions.",2,2025-12-05 02:38:36
"Higher level cards are Over powered. With a townhall 14 and cars of Level 14, you cannot push to 10500. I have been playing this game for around 11 years, but this time, the developers made this game a complete mesh.",1,2026-01-29 01:54:15
the game sucks and most of the battles I see is evo that I don't have cause the gacha so bad and it's paid to win. I stop playing for 2 months cause I reach to a level or arena thar most are paid to win that is high level and I wish it were much simpler were there are no evolution. and type this right now cause they add a hero for a troop where I see is level 14 hero musketeer where I was level 12 and my troops are 10 or 11 so this game is not playable I rather not spend my money that ruin fun,1,2025-12-10 22:09:53
"Im Done..after 8 year of playing this game everyday for hours,battling everyday,it was part of my daily duties just to get on top 15000 ranking points.Now,theres no sign of my progress (highest 14950 point),all the way back down to 10000 trophies,and getting 30 points per battle won...Im done,no need to put all the efforts and anger into this game anymore.Useless",1,2025-12-01 18:28:02
"Been playing this game since its release back in 2016, biggest regret of my life. Nearly 10 years and I was still not able to max out all my decks, and finally when I was nearly on the verge of maxing them out, greedycell had to add a new lvl. Game no longer feels fun, good luck and good bye.",1,2025-11-29 20:24:43
"December 2025 update ruined the game for me. you drop people down from 15k to 10k trophies and make it to where you only gain 30 trophies a win. I wont be enjoying this game for a while now because of this. there is a HUGE skill gap between 15,000 trophies and 10,000 trophies. im just curious what goes through supercells devs minds when they concoct trash like this. I can't even hop into a classic 1v1 to practice without getting stomped by a former 15k trophy player.",1,2025-12-03 07:19:53
"so after 10+ years of playing spent a lot of money to get a single deck maxed out and play with just so they introduce level 16, im done with this game as it became a scam if you took my money to max out my cards and then make it worthless, give me my money back, I will never play did game again, should be refunding people the money that you charged to Max out the cards since now they are not maxed out.",1,2025-12-08 02:41:48
"Too p2w, too many overlvled ppl and adding lvl 16 + heros while removing the competitive 2v2 without giving it any good rewards affer 10 games while making other useless modes that give basically 0 rewards really kills the game. Remove heros and level 16, bring back season shop and more rewards while completing all evos collections. Also make sure to buff chests to their old state and make items not exclusive to paywall.",1,2026-01-29 10:37:37
"GET RID OF THE HERO'S. They are basically champions in clash, Secondly, STOP BEING GREEDY, THE MORE GREEDY YOU ARE THE LESS PEOPLE ARE GONNA PLAY THE GAME.Put in like new champions or new evo's, BUT JUST GET RID OF THE HERO'S, I'll be honest IT USED TO BE A GOOD GAME,but now yall are putting in new HERO'S like almost every month and not listening to the fans that actually play this game, that's why I gave it a 1 star",1,2026-02-06 03:59:02
"This game is horrible. First of all, it has seriously level adventage issues, and even it also requires a luck because of first-card disadvantage. And the latest update, lvl 16 and heroes, the worst update of the last year because of supercell, this trash company is freaking blinded by the money. So my opinion is this game is worst and terrible game that I've ever played, and I don't even want to give you a zero, or minus 👎👎",1,2026-01-16 04:13:52
In the latest update free to play progress has been heavily limited. There no longer is a way to truly progress further in the game without spending vast amount of real life money. Stay away. *bad again* latest update: 70 usd for only one level 16 card 🫡,1,2025-11-27 17:40:49
"I have been playing this game for 8 years now, This game used to be love but now I am starting to hate it. Everytime a new update comes, or a new level of cards is introduced you have to spend 100s of dollars to max out your cards, but if you dont it will take you years and all that time you will be severly nerfed. STUPID PAY TO WIN GAME.",1,2025-12-21 16:51:52
"The game has become so difficult that it is no longer as enjoyable as before and players do not go to Clash Royale at any time to play a fun game! I am in Arena 15 but the game is so difficult and I am playing with opponents stronger than me that I have no hope of continuing and I accept defeat and I am going to say goodbye to this game, I am really sorry to you Supercell💔",1,2025-12-02 11:45:42
worst management ever !!! at this game's peak they launched heroes and level 16 cards....dude nobody wants this !!! This game can't even handle its server and connection issues...can't even play a single match...this game keeps restarting again and again !!!! Don't download this game to save your mental peace 🕊️,1,2025-12-26 15:50:11
I been an advid player of this game for years this latest update was very disappointing not only did they remove some of the content that I had purchased. The pass royale pass already feel short and most of content is becoming very expensive it almost feel like the are going away from the players that made them relevant.,3,2025-12-03 06:26:54
nothing new no cards just evos and hero which is basically just evos in a different look it's not that hard to think of card ideas.making them is hard they use to be doing 3 to 2 cards kinda often but now it just stopped for months maybe years I think,1,2026-02-06 00:35:35
"BRING BACK THE SEASON SHOP. Every update supercell gets more greedy. slowly the game is becoming more and more pay to win. Im a top ladder player, I make it to ultimate champion every season, but every update is more disappointing than the last. they need to stop taking stuff away from the battle pass and bring back chests. I hate lucky drops with every fiber of my being. heroic cards are an awful addition to the game too, just make more champions we dont need another version of card evolutions.",1,2025-12-01 16:58:33
"after this new update, the game is hard to log in and always disconnected. I thought it was my data that causes the problem, but my friends who uses different telco providers also experienced the same thing.",2,2026-01-12 00:55:57
"the pay to win in this game is ridiculous, once you get to king tower 10 everyone you face will out match you with lvl 14 n 15 cards n yhere is nothing you can do about it. unless you got a couple hundred bucks laying around I wouldn't even bother, fun for like a week and a half n you'll get stuck because you need to grind up your cards while other players just buy lvls, will be unistalling",2,2026-01-08 10:09:13
"Played this game since the start, and to be honest I'm not sure why I continue to play it but this game is so bad! Pay to win (or at least pay to get ahead), no original deck builds these days (not the games fault), no barring system for clans, the game may as well promote bullying through its emotes and lack of consequence for those jumping from clan to clan to hurl abuse to others. Updates are always a thing which is great... if the updates don't make things more complex.",1,2025-12-08 06:27:49
absolute trash. If you want to win you better pay. Any card that you spend your hard earned time leveling up with be countered instantly by toxic cards against a player who thinks winning is a credit card swipe away. the game isn't what it used to be and the new updates only make it worse. the non toxicity movement doesn't exist its still terrible and they are making more money off it with more toxic emotes for players. the community is based off of spenders and horny trend players. Do not play,1,2025-11-29 06:55:59
"Great gameplay, in my opinion one of the best mobile games of all time, rivaled only by coc which I recently got into. The reason I'm rating it 2 stars is because every season the updates keep getting worse and worse, and recently the new updates have been so bad that i feel like it's almost like each update is 2x worse than the last. They also have monthly balance changes which seems great until you realize they mostly use it to buff broken cards, and nerf balanced and bad cards.",2,2026-01-08 22:37:07
"Typical Supercell formula. Good game, fun mechanics and characters, well thought interactions but ultimately ensuring you hit that paywall. Good to play for a few weeks here and there, take a break and come back to.",4,2026-01-14 08:52:42
The game is FUN but the amount of commitment to keep up with the updates feels like chasing a carrot attached over ones own head. Validating time already spent by putting in even more time has proved to be an enjoyable chore.,3,2025-12-16 11:47:52
"Clash is one of the most fun games ever because it combines strategy, excitement, and creativity all in one. Players get to build their own base, train troops, and come up with unique battle strategies to defeat opponents. Every match feels different, and the challenge of outsmarting other players makes it endlessly entertaining. On top of that, the graphics and animations keep the gameplay fresh and enjoyable, making it easy to get hooked for hours. This game also deserves 5 stars because it",5,2025-09-14 08:59:40
"Ok, I guess. It used to be such a good game, but now it just seems as though everything is p2w. Games are extremely level dependent and the pass royale that gives the evolution just makes it more p2w. The update for losers was garbage and level 15 was the dumbest thing ever created, with the elite wild cards and all. Still gets 3 stars though for giving me many good moments along with my friends. Edit 29/11/25: I got back into the game for a while. Retired now. Level 16 and heros. Absolute trash",2,2025-11-30 02:44:45
"It hurts to hate this game becasue it used to be fun focused and I've loved this game for years. The game has gotten way too pay to win and near impossible for free players to advance and the fact that the level difference is insane and it costs money in order to win is so sad. The devs just need to listen to the community, nobody asked for level 16, we all loved the season shop, and we all loved chests yet the devs didn't listen to the community and continue to ignore them.",1,2025-12-09 14:27:53
"Game is great!! My only major complaint is that pay to win is too strong with level 16 and heroes. Other than that, it's nearly perfect! I'd recommend it to anyone!",4,2026-01-30 19:10:09
"Do not install unless you have major debt you want to add onto. This game used to be fair, it used to be balanced and when things were noticed as not balanced things would have been met with a counter unit or a balance update. Not anymore this game is hugely pay to play never mind pay to win. Heros? Who in their right mind decided that was a good idea!? Supercell are greedy fat people who are never gonna be what they used to be. Delete the game and boycott them!!!! Do not give them anymore cash",1,2026-01-29 19:09:53
Match making is a joke. When you first install this you will win but your win streaks won't last. They make sure to place you with decks and players of higher levels or that counter your deck. Count the elixir that drops too because some players put 2xs as much as you can. Wish there was a zero star ranking.,1,2026-01-30 13:47:28
"used to be the best game ever, since the Hero's update it's gone so pay to win they only think about revenue and no cares given about retaining players or player engagement....we complain they release another hero's update thinking that if it's cute we won't notice....we complain the release hero's again....I'm so sad that supercell are killing this game as I have been playing for years",2,2026-01-29 18:29:26
"Constantly matched with players that are a higher level than me with cards from higher arenas. Also there are a lot of cheaters in here, no report button either. Cant tell me that someone can spam 6 elixir troops 3 times in a row lmao",1,2026-01-28 23:14:30
I have played this game for almost 10 years now. it has literally become unplayable unless you are willing to spend multiple hundreds of rands every single month for the new best gimmic and over powered cards... I'm so over it,1,2026-02-01 01:18:45
"This is a nice tower-defense game and is very interesting to play but the only thing which bothers me is that there are very less modes in this game, I wanted more modes and more things to play with.",4,2026-01-10 15:07:53
"So, the game Is more and more Broken as the time goes like unbelievable. Game in mid of match just disconnect you, with reason that your connection is weak, but it's not. Heroes - heroes are something, what for me, is very boring to play, but it's OP. so let's pay for them, and play before they nerf them into unplayable piece of cake. Lvl 16 killed it totally, money winning over people's opinions, and game itself, just turning into really big mess.",1,2026-01-30 05:19:20
"every few games there is always a damn cheater having 2x resources at the start of the match. getting real fatigued to continue playing, if this is all the game mounts up to be.",1,2026-01-30 08:26:01
It's a horrible bar made game all it does is causes stress and promotes pay to winning so you waste money just to keep playing because everyone you face has max level troops while all you have is lower level troops.,1,2026-01-30 10:57:10
"Why has there never been any improvement regarding the signal either when logging in or in the game, so when playing it is always very slow? PLEASE FOLLOW UP",1,2026-01-29 20:38:01
Pay to win. new addition of these heroes are a money wall. 2 months of playing and I've only unlocked one. they are releasing em faster than FTP players can unlock em. shame. going to uninstall.,1,2026-01-29 23:54:12
"Absolutely the worst match-making ever created. If you think Call of Duty was bad, then multiply it by 5 and this is what is given. Although the game can be enjoyable it's really more pay to win.",1,2025-11-26 04:22:14
I would much rather burn my phone then play this. I regret installing. Waste of storage. The game is so repetitive and annoying and i really regret playing this.,1,2026-01-30 04:12:06

"Tedious pay-to-win slop. Used to be quite exciting, but now the winner is simply based on who paid and who didn't. Don't waste your time unless you have deep pockets.",1,2026-01-30 00:29:57
Supercell is a MASTER at AI generated abysmal teammates to throw your games or over leveled opponents to block you from progressing. I have NEVER seen a game more shameless in this tactic.,1,2026-01-29 05:09:22
Matching making is the worse. Each update fixes something & ruins everything more. I miss the original game so much. But I know u don't care for my opinion. This is just for giggles.,2,2026-01-28 22:09:05
I play this game entirely too much but I hate the fact that I do. I've been playing almost consistently for the last 6 years and I still don't have a maxed out card. once you get to higher arenas the outcome is almost completely dependent on who spent the most money or who had the better match up. I don't mean to sound egotistical but I'm better then almost 90 percent of the people in my arena I just lose to credit cards and unlucky match-ups. last of all nerf hog rider it's way too good rn,1,2025-11-30 15:39:40
"ive been playing it already for a while since 2016, and it's been pretty great, I love that's it's all about strategy and everytime it's more challenging but fun cause you keep learning new ways to play and makes you actually think outside the box making you use all these strategys outside the game and for other things, it makes you be more open minded.",5,2026-01-14 06:52:18
"I used to play since it came out.. used to be my favorite game...but now thr game became ""Pay2Win"" now if u dont wasted money in the game you will be at a disadvantage! i still play here and there untill i get whooped by someone that paid money to have ""Super Troops"" or w.e. they're called..

"coming from a 9 year badge holder🤢 : it's addicting once u start playing. i'll often find myself in an endless loop of hitting the play again button. but other than that there's nothing really memorable about the gameplay itself. Over all it's a meh game. I always end up feeling wasted once I'm done playing cuz it's the same decks , same recursive gameplay same pay 2 win spoiled brats spamming the 🐖💃🏼 emote. It's unrewarding. win or lose it's all the same.",1,2026-01-09 22:43:16
this game poves time and time again that they don't care about anything the community says or wants in the game and keeps braking every single promise they make. They keep adding stuff nobody wanted or asked for just to cash in as much money as possible and it keeps working because people LOVE pay to win games. I love this game with passion and been playing since launch but level 16 and heroes spilled the cup that was already beated up by all the terrible decisions made for money. Very disappoin,1,2026-01-01 13:00:31
please remove heroes and please remove the pay 2 win system in the game. I'm trying to have fun while I see no skill cards being placed constantly with absurd levels above me. I honestly want to give up on this game because it's basically unplayable unless you use cards that only need one brain cell to use,1,2026-01-11 18:46:42
I used to love the game but now they ruined it after the hero update. I have beat the game got ult champ and 20 wins but they ruined the game when chasing profit and instead of actually making the game fun with higher card levels. again it's sad what this game used to be and what it's becoming played the game since it came out with different accounts and wish the game the best but the game like I predicted start of update is going to die.,1,2026-01-03 21:14:27
"So now the game is only a PAY TO WIN type.. all the powerfull card are only available if you buy... so people who can AFFORD to buy ""ECHO SAGE"" will rule the merge tactics and player like me who doesnt spend money on game are on the same level since 7 yr and new player with money and heavy card are growing fast like hell",1,2026-01-18 01:59:48
"Just when I thought they couldn’t release a worse update than Clan War 2 they dropped level 15 update. And I thought okay they did worse but it stops now. And then they surprised us with chest removal, nerfing season shop and pass royale. Just great! Well well, you have surpassed your previous scam now with lvl 16 update. Been playing for 9 years. It's time to quit and spend times in other games that actually care about all players not just p2w players.",1,2025-11-25 11:05:12
Got one of the worst games ever filled with lots of MOD Gamers with unlimited elexir or will match with higher level players wantedly to buy cards for upgrades... i started hating this game since it's lack of monitoring MOD Gamers and Matching with higher level players.,1,2025-12-14 01:41:56
this game isn't just p2w it's pay to play the game is soo unbalanced adding level 16 cards was the worst move and they thought yes let's add heros to balance it AND SOMEHOW THAT MADE THE SITUATION EVEN WORSE,1,2026-01-31 07:57:33
"With the last update supercell has shown it's community how it is a greedy company that turned the game into a totally pay to win game, no one asked for level 16 and no one asked for the heroes, and one more thing, with the heroes in the game what exactly is the use of champions as they are simply the same with the ability which was the only thing differentiating champions",1,2025-12-22 04:46:23
"really good game, not much lag except for the occasional match selling freeze, had good mechanics and is really easy to get to arena 17 and unlock every card... But after that its kind of just an up and down of being stuck in the same arena for 50 matches because of p2w. ill just be chilling and then I go up against a person that's lvl 12 towers but lvl 15 cards which is a tremendous difference from lvl 11 and 12 cards. would give higher rating, just too p2w",3,2025-12-12 11:35:13
Worst matchmaking i have ever seen in a game. Matchmaking shouldn't only be based on trophies but also levels. How is it fair for a f2p player with level 13s to face against the new level 16s? You money hungry devs don't give out enough cards to balance things for new f2p players. The last time i've genuinely enjoyed playing was in the lower arenas because the levels actually make sense.,1,2025-12-07 11:54:06
"absolute garbage, got back into clash after 3 years of not playing and this game has been completely ruined. stuck using one or two decks due to limited resources because im broke, cant even play my favorite decks due to matchmaking giving me back to back to back hardcounters when i switch to beatdown cashgrab, do not play this game. i am quitting",1,2025-12-20 05:32:14
"Still pay to win garbage! I'm doing good and having close games with opponents, some best me fair and square but I'm gradually gaining trophies. Then come across players that have maxed out evolutions to which are broken af so I have no shot at winning leading me in an endless cycle of bs!!!",1,2025-12-05 08:04:28
"we already knew this was a pay to win slop, but now you aren't even trying to hide it anymore with these hero cards! there's an objectively best hero, and an objectively worst one, with the drop chances also being tweaked so that you're more likely to get the worse one! you can get better chances at obtaining the good ones, by buying the pass(15€), of course! and no other game has made me want to break my opponents phone in half more than Clash Royale. Playerbase? don't even get me started!",1,2025-12-12 04:13:39
"eomm is real. i know i lose games and they're my fault, all losses are— but when you have to play the same deck every f***ing time, it gets really annoying. normal mm is you could play someone good, bad, a bit of both. games were good climbing up, but once I got closer to legendary arena, the progress slowed, better comp. but eomm kicks in after a win streak/new peak/arena. they'll put u against decks u always lose to devs buff meta and punish one deck playstyles. I dont even play meta cards",2,2025-12-14 02:25:34
"Clash Royale has become a terrible game. It’s completely pay-to-win now, and the matchmaking algorithm is awful. It constantly pairs you against counter decks, making the experience extremely frustrating. The user experience keeps getting worse.The game used to be amazing back in 2016,but now it has turned into a very disappointing and poorly balanced game. And honestly, I’ve finally rage-quit this game. Congratulations to Clash Royale for turning a fun 2016 classic into a frustration simulator",1,2025-12-02 15:29:57
"Absolutely horrible game. Firstly you never really get a match with a real player because everyone uninstalled this game because of how bad it is. Second, they made the AI 10 times harder, to the point where AI is actually cheating. They can deploy upto 4 troops in a single go, which is impossible due to elixir constraints. Then they added invincible skeletons.... If you prefer a sound mind, keep away from this rotten game.",1,2025-12-19 11:22:23
"All you ever see is mega knight. mega knight, mega knight, mega knight. And then they decide to give me an evolved version which makes it even more annoying. It makes the game so hard to try and have fun and try new things out. I can't enjoy it anymore.",1,2026-01-28 19:59:24
"This game is good in many aspects, but it's becoming so bad is many other, the pay to win wall is so stupid and now I can't even play ranked because the match making sets me with max out players lvl 15 king and my cards aren't even lvl 13? this game makes no sense in that aspect and don't even get me started with war days when I mainly get matched with overpowered players who are toxic at me for being underlevel. The easy fix is to fix the match making, bc for now this game sucks. No enjoyment.",1,2025-12-07 16:25:05
every single update in the past 2 months has been greedy to make the game harder to progress for the casual free to play player. they have practically ruined the game for new/returning players. 2 months ago i would say this game was amazing now im strugging to keep it insalled on my phone,1,2025-12-22 22:18:06
fun . game but when i open the game then it reloads 24/7 every time after 20seconds when i battle somebody then it reloads and i cant play it then after 18 second i comeback to the battle and my opponent has already knocked my 1st tower then it reloads again then he has won the game that's annoying and unplayable even tho i have internet,4,2025-12-04 20:36:02
Pekka. Yeah nvm they are nerfing the biggest MK counter aka pekka next season level 16 is terrible and garbage nobody wants to play with those also btw there are so many ways you could keep the game f2p without cosmetics because i dont think money for cosmetics is the best thing but you know it is still bad its just that there are so many ways to turn everything that costs money free by just adding a little bit of grinding even with the seasonal evos they should not be locked behind a paywall,3,2025-11-30 10:48:25
"it's wayyyy too p2w! what were the devs thinking?? the latest updates only added super overpowered cards that are LOCKED behind PAYWALLS! okay, not fully locked, but leveling them up or unlocking them without paying money IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE!! All the new additions only made this p2w problem worse, the devs adding heroes and level 16 IS INSANE! If you don't buy the new OP card or evolution or hero every season you got no chance to win!",1,2025-12-08 02:13:49
"another straight trash update. They ljust nuked the playability and wrecked all the fun. so many store bought players now it's insane. those of us who grinded for many years are now just slaughtered by just store bought level 16s. they completely screwed over all the loyalists who burned away so many gems and coins and more because there was no other options. what a joke this game has become. just dumb now. merge tactics is about the only fun thing now, and they are already ruining that too.",2,2025-12-08 13:56:29
After a few updates it's become basically impossible to play through the game without spending real money it's hard to get wild cards and gold and every time I get a 5 star lucky chest it's for the most useless stuff like heal spirt,1,2026-01-07 13:34:18
"Recently after each update you're requiring me to free ridiculous amount of storage space, today it's 2GB+ just for some update. In part my fault for having a full storage, but this lack of optimisation is absurd. I can't keep deleting things, so I can't play CR anymore...",2,2025-12-21 05:27:27
"Absolute dogshit game. Matchmaking is a complete scam — constantly throwing me against opponents 2–3 levels higher and pretending it’s fair. That’s not competition, that’s pay-to-win trash. Overleveled troops, broken low-elixir spam, zero balance. Skill means nothing when card levels decide the match. Fix the matchmaking, nerf the busted cards, or watch players uninstall and never look back. This game is broken and deserves the backlash.",1,2026-02-01 18:36:57
"Game is so slow and takes forever to build up elixir. Opponents drop 3 warriors before I even get one. I play on a Samsung s8 so not the phone. Internet speed to plenty. Every time I play I just get so frustrated. 5 years later I thought I would give the game another crack but still the same, I build 1 elixir by the time my opponent has put three player down, how are you suppose to battle against that. they say you build one elixir every 2.8 seconds, I have timed it and it takes over 5. pathetic",1,2025-12-26 22:10:45
"I'm disappointed with whoever makes the decisions for this game. I used to to love this game, it was amazing and unique, but now they've turned it into disgusting P2W trash. Devs never listen to the community and only care about filling their accounts with money. Throughout many seasons devs have done nothing but make progression worse and harder for free to play players. If you wanna play this trash then get ready to loose not because you're worse, but because you didn't spend money.",1,2026-02-03 03:32:38
"the game has completely fallen off from when I had last played before I redownloaded in 2016 when the max was arena 7 can't go two games without seeing mega knight or Evo witch, also these heros are stupid af and level 16, fix your damn game supercell",2,2026-02-01 08:02:43
"The new update is causing major lag both while loading the game and mid-game crashes. It’s ruining the experience—please fix these stability bugs soon! Samsung S23 Ultra, happens on both 5G and on Stable WiFi.",1,2026-01-11 16:55:13
"uninstalling for rigged matchmaking Without a doubt, this used to be one of my favorite games to play. However, recent changes have rendered it frustrating and unplayable. From heroes to pay2win to matchmaking that is aimed at keeping you within a specific range of trophies, this needs to be fixed or else you will lose your fanbase.",1,2025-12-27 07:02:55
I hate that i enjoy this game so much because the creators are greedy McCreedy's who rip away hard earned elite status (which some people earn by paying actual money for!) in order to make people want to put money into the game to get back their elite status. Here's a thought! quit being lazy and make new characters instead of ripping people off of their elite status so they have to gain it all over again. Get some new ideas or your going to lose your loyal gamers...,2,2025-11-24 20:23:32
"Level 16 is... amazing... -ly bad I used to love this game when games actually need skill. Now there's a new level and new hero mechanics, adding way too many elements into a simple game that ruins the gameplay. Very disappointed when they broke their vow.",1,2025-12-20 20:33:08
do not download this slop game. It is filled to the brim of micro transactions making the game majorly unfair. The dev team is insanely egotistical and recently have been digging this games grave.,1,2026-02-11 21:59:47
"One of the most trash games I ever played take me back to the old 2016-2019 clash when all you need to do was to rank up no purchases , no lvl max , no excuses to not enjoy the game , today is one of the most pay to win game I ever played games , trash and stupid rules and toxic upgrades that the Supercell company gave a fk to put . L game . Not reccomanded.",1,2025-12-30 03:13:20
"before would say 4 to 5 star game now its gone significantly downhill. too many pay to win elements no fun. i can deal with pay to win to level cards as you just gotta grind daily chests to get them fairly and naturally, albeit slightly longer. However, nowhere near enough coins given to keep up with stuff. To make the game and progression at least partially playable give us more money from chests/wins or at least reduce coin costs. It is too ridiculous post lvl 10 to upgrade units.",3,2025-12-17 08:41:04
"The game just screams pay-to-win. I recently started playing, and I've encountered countless PTW guys. It's ridiculous. Do you expect people to play a game where it doesn't take skill but money to advance? I have screenshots of games where I (9) have to battle against level 10 (ok I guess), 11, 12, or even 13! Which also brings us to matchmaking, which is also problematic. Same levels, not trophies, should determine who you play with. The game has many smaller issues as well...",1,2025-10-03 06:27:47
This game was so fun to play as a f2p back in 2022 but now its just a huge money grab. Supercell doesn't put any effort into their games they value money over their community and release the most broken cards and evos you have ever heard of. The games are so repetitive too. I face the same 3 cards every game. And the release of the heroics just made the game unplayable. And for the love of christ keep 2v2 its the literal only fun thing in the entire game.,1,2025-12-16 08:15:38
"fun at the start boring to the end, community not to friendly and throught when I played this game I see lots of people absolutely abusing certain cards and just taking the fun and creativity when playing this game cause then it forces you to have to use that card and taking away the whole point of making your own deck, but otherwise I'd play the game if you get bored or something. (Remove Pay TO Win)",1,2025-11-28 00:33:54
"At first I was upset about Evo and heroes and all of the new mechanics as a long time player of 9 years, currently at 9500 trophies... Over time however it is becoming more fun because everything is becoming OP so all decks can be good. 4 stars because it is slightly pay to win but I am mostly f2p and still hold my ground. PLEASE BRING BACK $5 PASS ROYALE FOR 5 STARS!!!",4,2025-11-30 15:34:32
"after a few updates the game us even worse to be a free to play in addition the amount of bots there are and not real people gets old, plus the ranking system sucks, sometimes the player leaves the match and I win fast so it puts me against a max level 17 player that will clap me due to me having level 10s and 1 level 13, baloon is my only chance of winning by making it sneaky with pancakes I used 4k gems to upgrade it twice to 14 and barely win since 3 minions fully counter it",2,2026-01-07 10:56:50
"the latest update is utterly horrible. for a free to play player, supercell is basically telling us to pay for a already heavily nerfed yet nerfed again pass royale. new heroes are absolutely broken, lvl 16 changes the entire meta. It's not enjoyable to play anymore like it used to. You will just keep losing to pay2win players with their op lvl 16 hero deck, especially at high ladder.",1,2025-12-10 18:10:25
"Game was amazing until December hit because level 16 and heroes ruined gameplay. The devs are only here for cash grabs, and there is pretty much no saving this. All I play against over 10k is megaknight this and megaknight that. The only games I enjoy to play anymore is clan wars and friends.",1,2025-12-23 00:46:25
"If coming back from not playing for a long (and I mean long long time) you practically have to start over because Evolutions have completely broken the game and made it unplayable, there is no winning if they have an Evolution. at least give returning players 1 evo or something",1,2026-01-22 06:40:54
this is a very fun game. but it is quite addictive and grindy. but the addition of heros and lvl 16 completely ruined the game. the pay to wins are even more overpower and overleveled ruining the gaming experience of free to play players like me. trust me and delete the game.,2,2026-02-03 16:46:15
"You already dragged the game downhill with those pointless evolutions like the Electro Dragon, but adding these ridiculous super-extra heroes (the yellow cards) is where you completely lost the plot. This update isn’t just bad it’s the most embarrassing, game-ruining mess I’ve ever seen. It honestly feels like you’re trying to speed-run destroying your own game.",1,2025-12-03 09:09:20
"2v2 mode is very very fun, please update it i want to be able to use preset messages and pins to tell my teammate things and point at places in the arena like defend and i point to our right tower or use spells and point at the opponents left tower or something midmatch. aswell as other updates for it because i love that mode",5,2025-12-15 05:09:02
"This game was good back in 2016. Now ever since they started adding the hero cards and evolution card no sense, this game has become a pay to win game beyond imagination. The shop is full of clikbait to buy stuff with real money too.",1,2025-12-22 10:12:58
"I was really enjoying the game before the new update, even as a returning player. The new update has just made the game so blatantly pay to win I have been finding it borderline unplayable. I still enjoy the game overall but this new update has killed any motivation to climb",2,2025-12-09 01:32:14
"the amount of times I wanted to destroy my phone because of this game is to much all the p2w and the ""I'm so good at this game"" people there are because the spend money on this game. but any way the game is fun in till that one card the one card is the most annoying thing ever created by human kind but the game is fun tho 3 stars",3,2025-12-07 20:03:58
Been playing for 5+ years thousands of gems stacked up and at one point millions in coins yet stuck at 14. The game was better before all the evolution cards and level 15 king tower required $$ to advance (win) should introduce a money emote for taunting. 2025 update two years getting most of my cards to level 15 and they just downgrade them all to 14 and convert an my and cards smh what a bs move. I refuse to dump any money into this game.,1,2025-12-29 09:21:46
This most recent update has shown even more than it used to be that supercell only wants those willing to spend money on the game to get an advantage or win every deck I see is already maxed out (lvl16) and most contain the new hero cards wouldn't recommend playing if you don't intend to spend some money,1,2025-12-04 01:59:11
This game is so unbelievable pay to win if you want to progress fast you have to pay if you want your cards to be evolved or heroic which makes the card 10 times better you have to pay for it,1,2026-02-12 06:08:20
"Hello Supercell, i actually really enjoy this game. But there is one big problem, you are ruining it so hard, everyone is quiting, i can only beg you to stop, and make the game fun for us again, beacuse we want it, but it seems like you dont want it. GRACIAS SUPERCELL",1,2025-12-28 20:31:53
"my friend actually showed this game to me like in november and now, it's pretty fun to see me just winning one time but then getting bad luck again now. the game is basically like a tower defense when you find an opponent and stuff. the tutorial makes the game pretty easy to understand, too. when you watch videos of people playing the game, you probably know what to do when you download it.",5,2025-12-31 17:21:36
"This is the first review Ive ever given. Im a 9 year vet, that is frustrated on how the game is now pay to play. Years of grinding to have the game turn into what it is now. Fun but I'm sickened by the way it is now. I understand wanting to make bank, but im just disappointed.",1,2025-12-18 13:27:41
Used to be enjoyable and a fun concept for a game. Company only cares about money anymore and purposefully releases terrible updates to promote their newest money trap.,1,2026-02-05 05:32:25

"The hero update is garbage and ive had 10 seconds of play time with it, what the hell do you mean that you took my book of epics and all I got was 10 wild cards, what the hell. Also, I'm tired of supercell reinforcing pay to win because how has level 16 been out for only a few hours and already people have 2 or 3 in their deck",1,2025-11-25 04:14:01
This is a clear pay to win game.I been playing this game for 2 years but this game only give update that are worst. This is my second review after this shitiest upgrade. This update just make my all efforts waste.I am just a normal player who doesn't waste money. It take me 2 years and more to make my card level 15 but this greedy clash royale developer just make card level 16 which they don't even give compensation.I had more to rant but only 500 letter is allowed so i will end here.,1,2025-11-24 21:14:24
"Clash Royale is no longer a skill-based game. It is a pay-to-win cash grab that punishes anyone who doesn’t constantly spend money. The meta is garbage. Balance is a joke. Overleveled cards decide matches before they even start, and matchmaking exists purely to frustrate players into spending. Skill barely matters anymore — card levels and spending do. Progression is deliberately throttled to push microtransactions. Cards are released broken, left broken dont waste time on this game unless🤑🤑",1,2026-01-24 01:45:23
"The game is addictive. but I have a big complaint, the supercell support team isn't reliable at all. i made a purchase for an emote, made the transaction successfully but didn't get the emote. i tried to reach out to the support team but they stopped responding after 2 messages. my money got wasted. i sent an email and didn't get any response. either give me the emote, for which I payed you already or refund my money, supercell. it possing me off.",3,2025-12-21 18:37:31

"The entire point of this game is using the best card ""The credit card""🫩AMD STOP MAKING EVERY GAME I PLAY 99% CHANCE TO LOSE.

I used to love this game, now I am never going to download this excuse again.",1,2025-12-20 19:58:17
before Clash Royal was perfect until they launch champions evolutions then now heroes ruining the entire gameplay again with mismatched cards then extending the level adding up and up for you to upgrade and buy again when i started playing it the maximum level was 8 then they added it up and up now not sure if its until level 16 so disappointed please bring back the old clash royal!,2,2025-12-03 04:41:02

More pay to win than ever. and now level 16.... this game is so unplayable it's not even funny. Facing full decks 2 levels higher is impossible. I've been playing for 9 years and still have had a max level deck once. Completely pay to win trash.,1,2026-01-08 10:04:35

I would give less but can't I give it a 1 star because I keep coming across pay to wen and it sucks. stop making it so you can level up your people to max level and why in area 11 it's so unfair Plus you can buy cards that are not unlocked until very high arena by just buying it which is very annoying to go against and why do I go against players that are 100 trophies above me like this game is as I was about to get to arena 12 and I just lost until I got back to the bottom and that why I'd less,1,2025-12-12 09:53:11

Genuinely love the game but everything is pay to win and you cant make any *good* progress unless you spend money. The game is enjoyable until around arena 13 - 15 but then you just go against over leveled opponents and it just isn't fun anymore.

"I'm arena 18 and a free to play player, the game was fun when I first started playing but now the game just adds overpowered stuff that no one asks for and the game is now just p2w as hell. This game pays no attention to the community and all they care about atp is money. There is no balance to some cards like, mega knight, bose bandit etc, there is no balance with some Evo and the heroics like the mini pekka, heroics are is overpowered as hell this game and the creators suck.",1,2026-01-08 07:08:09
pretty unbalanced in most of the time limited progression. you're gonna be a lower level unless you buy it. I've hoped it'd get fixed but they're making it worse. if you haven't played it then don't start it now.,3,2025-12-16 08:09:26
"Unfortunately, the game is not what it used to be. Still kinda playable, but the performance lacks, a lot, constantly having internet problems in glimpses which made me lose a couple of won matches. Also is quite laggy sometimes usually when opening chests or loading the screen. Edit:The game is preventing me to play now, it's terrible. On clan wars it says I should create a war deck before, which I did, not even changed it. But it keeps showing the same error, and now on casual without warning.",1,2025-09-19 20:29:41
I took 1 star because its a bit laggy. but the game is entertaining and fun! Clash Royale in my opinion is nearly better than Block Blast.,4,2026-01-31 16:13:32
"Game ran by a money hungry company please balance the cards out all they care about it making money and not caring about the community the game is terrible and when i try cancelling the match it puts me into one anyways. the game puts me with 9 years playerz when ive only been playing the game for a few months and they havr people with level 14 cards when i have level 11 which is the average, your balance team is absolutely terrible like who on earth decides to make a card called mega knight",1,2026-01-24 14:16:09
"can be fun at times, but way to pay to win. You will be trying to play a normal game in arena 5, and some guy will have level 16 cards, megaknight, inferno dragon, and mini pekka. If supercell wasn't so greedy, maybe this game would be playable for more than 10 minutes.",3,2026-01-26 05:39:40
"The game has been becoming much more p2w recently, and there are level 11 people with max level cards left and right... the problem is matches like those require no strategy and the opponent can simply place overleveled troops and your low level towers have nothing to do against it. Most of these people do not even have a year played",1,2025-11-26 09:33:11
"Clash Royale Is Pure Trash—Greedy, Broken, and Not Worth a Second! Let’s keep it brutal: Clash Royale is less a game, more a predatory cash-grab that treats players like walking ATMs. Save your time, money, and sanity—this dumpster fire isn’t worth touching. The matching system is a scam. No skill involved—just punishment. Grind weeks to level your deck, then get paired with pay-to-win losers with cards 3+ levels higher. Your ""strategy"" means nothing when their overleveled Mega Knight",1,2025-12-03 02:19:00
this game must have some algorithm cus I win 1 game then I lose 3 in a row and all the players are over leveled. this game needs to be fixed. Another thing is that there are hackers in the game that stop you game and lag you out causing you to lose. supercell fix your damn games if you want people to respect you as a company,1,2026-01-21 14:16:37
very very bad game just pure chaeting with user if winner is winning most of three games then doesn't digest that so that start losing the user even he is best and just trying to increase screen time on their games and purposphuly defeating user very badly so pathetic very hilarious and very average game i suggest to play this game anymore if anyone plays uninstall this dump from your phone,1,2026-02-13 12:00:25

My highest card is level 12 and lowest is 10 but I am getting matched with people who have fully maxed out decks on trophy road.

"My son introduced me to this game a couple years ago. Took me a week or so to learn how to actually play somewhat tactical, but now it's one of my favorite games. Never have had any issues with it either or had to pay for anything. their daily rewards and battle wins are sufficient enough for casual players like me. Would definitely recommend.",5,2026-01-06 11:01:54
It's an amazing game but it literally takes years to fully level up thanks to level 16 and they made it harder for free to play players but also so many people think that they are good at the game just by using the most unskilled cards ever and it's beyond pay to win like I just went against 5 people in a row that were pay to win on top of that the people that are pay to win are beyond toxic then they took our books for gems that was so little gems it disgusting (Supercell get rid of level 16),1,2025-11-30 21:15:24
"Game is pay to win. If you don't spend money and have the highest level cards, you get destroyed and you won't have any fun. They keep adding more and more levels for you to buy your way into and it's no longer a game I'd recommend to anyone.",1,2025-12-18 03:05:53
I don't know why but the game is so done. it had they added level 16 and after that the game is lagging. it ticks your ability to play the game. I was trying to use my champions ability but I didn't. I wasn't able to use it for some reason. the game is so done,1,2025-12-13 06:19:37

it's simple if ur not paid to win Goodluck cause this game ain't the same I used to love this game I played it everyday and now it's so bad honestly they ruined the game so much what makes it worst is the players who spend there life savings on this game it's not fun anymore mind you I've played 4 matches in a row and won and im only gaining 26 trophies then j lose one and im losing 32 trophies like u just progressively go down after a loss then what u would from a win..,1,2025-12-15 13:27:56
at the start of the game it's easy but I guess people like to push 3 crown they like men and that is basically arena 18 and 19. when it came out for the first time it was balance. but now the just want money and everyone spend money on this retarded game so if you to spend money and be toxic this the game.,1,2026-01-06 13:57:39

"The game itself is pay to win but still VERY playable for free to play players like me. I would give it 4 stars because of that. BUT supercell made progression a bit easier for free to play players by adding a seasonal challenge which thus season for example gives you a hero at arena 15 ! And the game is a bit addicting but it also takes skill with some decks and strategy. So, in conclusion im giving it a 4 star since its a good game actually but still not very good enough for 5 make it better!",5,2025-12-03 00:08:13

They add stuff that is incredibly pay to win and decide to not only lock it behind a paywall but they also implement a gambling system to even get something out of it you want.

Unasked for and expensive p2w updates like level 16 and hero cards have been added, and it's not worth it. CR had a slight revival and greedysell thinks it's a good idea to cash out now instead of making the game better for its users, and this time it's actually the Devs being greedy because CEOs don't call the shots.",1,2025-11-25 06:01:58

The hero updates the worst things ever. The season music is the worst I ever heard in Clash Royale history like the updates where they cut ur progression. Every year clash creator I used to love to hype it up and it's not as bad as it seems and every year I get back at the game. I am unsubbing all the clash creators and also this game that I was used to love. Because listening to clash creators and downloading this game almost 2 months ago was a mistake again.,1,2025-12-10 13:17:24

The game is very much ok but now due to theur greed it just turn into pay to win Very wasted game Its a good game but its very obvious the developers just wants more money by turning it into pay to win game It ruin all yhe fun You can have an opponents with only level 11 tower but all troops around 15 to 16 Its just not the same anymore Im quiting this game,1,2025-12-03 01:30:27

"the game itself is fun, but once you get to a certain point you go against people who are over leveled, which is very quickly annoying when your one win away and go against a person who's level 10 as a level 8. how about instead of ranking it only by trophies you rank it by level and card level average too. im quiting this game because supercell is so good at having a terrible ranking system.",3,2025-11-30 01:25:32

Such an addictive game. Once you play and are pushing trophies you won't be able to get off the game (at least until you hit 10k I took a small break then). People complain about the p2w aspect and I do agree clash is p2w I hit 10k without spending any money but facing over leveled people is annoying and I get why people complain. I think though there is a point when you hit so many trophies or unlock ranked and want to be serious you may encounter a decision if you want to start spending money.,5,2025-12-16 03:56:53

Played this game for 7 years now and they have made this into a pay to play mess . The progression system was actually really good until a little while ago but the developers just took out the core progression mechanic with no viable alternative .

it's pretty 67 mango and help show the peak of human emotions (rage) like at one point i throw my phone in the my pool that how fun the game is. but the problems for me is the prices is not high enough like gems only cost 5 bucks when there value is so high like you can upgrade everything with it so I hope supercell would increase the prices not only in aus but everywhere. but that's just me,5,2026-01-09 05:12:01

super heavily monetized while making less and less F2P friendly and way more grindy. There new monetization value to level up a singular card is over 20$ or a bunch or grinding that takes forever.

worst game ever i wish i could give it 0 stars. Always places you against hard counters every other game and is very frustrating to play plus this new hero thing is not helping at all. you have to grind all the way to 10k trophies just to get the max amount of value from the boxes(which barely gives you any shards to get a hero) PLUS you can't even choose what hero you get its random which is not ideal.

I don't like this game basically because when you get trophies and you lose you lose the trophies so when I was so close to getting to the next island or whatever I got sent back multiple times,1,2026-01-18 01:20:13
"once you get in the higher arenas, things get way worse, I'm in arena 16 and each and every game I play is against mk, lumber loon, swarm decks, logbait and many more annoying decks, it also takes about 1 month or less to get out of arenas after arena 13-14 I think, there are probably hundreds of thousands of toxic players around the platform giving you an unpleasant experience, overall this game is the definition of pay to win and I DO NOT recommend this game at all.",2,2026-01-07 16:43:11
I was having a wonderful time playing this game but today it was the opposite. I clicked the game and I asked me for an update so I updated it after that it told me to do the tutorial even though I have been playing for months and have a lot of in game progress. can this be fixed?,2,2026-01-09 00:06:19
"Been playing a long time, soon as you stop paying for things game slows down elixir, delays troop deployment to ensure you lose and matches you with decks over and over that always neutralize what you have.

"in the last 1 and a half month the Devs have somehow managed to do 4 years of damage, handicapping f2p players, releasing pay to win cards and mechanics, removing progression items that helped massively, nerfing lucky boxes that give nothing, players played for years aren't even close to maxing one deck before the meta shifts, AND NOW THERES ANOTHER LEVEL TO CLIMB THAT ADDS NOTHING BUT MORE GRIND AND MONEY FOR GREEDYCELL!

it just isnt fair that i come back to the game and there are people with two heroes while im stuck with hero giant and the only way to get them is to pay 12.99 not to mention they added two extra levels that you have to just play the game to get unless of course you have money and its not just a small grind ive played since the update on and off and i only have one lvl15 it needs to be easier to get the broken cards they know what theyre doing,1,2026-01-13 22:15:08

a very good strategy game featuring fast paced mini games and crucial positioning but super cell needs to tone down on the pay to wins the way supercell is giving the pay to wins domination over the game is too much the store gives players guarenteed cards and showcases them for to long one way to improve this is to possibly change the amount of time a card shows up in the store to maybe 1 day or even 1 hour possibly if pay too wins ever get the nerf they deserve I'll rate clash 5 star,3,2025-11-26 23:15:40
"It's interesting that 99% of the people who are saying the game is too pay to win, are from 6k-8k trophies, thats called mid latter, that's just the point where the skilled players stand out from the ones who are just bad at the game. It's not like the people who write these reviews are the only people who have to deal with this, I am actually free to play and shure, mid latter is probably that hardest zone, if you are actually skilled, you can get past it. don't listen to those reviews.",5,2025-12-21 08:05:15
"would give 0 stars if I could. Fun concept but the company is just to greedy, every update things get worse, f2p is basically unplayable and after something has been op for about 3 months they nerf it into the ground and give it to everyone in an attempt to not look greedy. it's like an abusive relationship and never let's you go, do not play this",1,2026-01-22 16:15:03
I think the games really fun and I'm really new to the game and already and joining it my only complaint is I'm starting to think if I please this more and more it's going to get a little repetitive and boring but I can't say it yet because I'm still new obviously the overall a really good game and I recommend if you get bored of other games,4,2025-12-29 05:51:46
This game is so unrewarding unless you spend $500 on the game when I play a normal deck at 8000 trophies every single game there is a mega knight and in midladder eveyone runs the same thing that they spend $3502 on and I spend $70 dollars into this game to boost myself and even though i play every single day I have been in arena 21 since october and have played every single day. Supercell needs to nerf Mega Knight into the core of the earth and make this game playable for everyone.,1,2025-12-16 11:11:50
the amount of p2w players are so frustrating because I don't spend money on the game and when I'm about to finish a hard arena this game puts me up against the most down bad p2w player and I lose than after that I go onto a losing streak it makes me go crazy but it is still a decent game for people who wanna have fun oh and also it's only easy untill like pekkas playhouse so good luck with that👍,3,2025-12-30 14:25:34
new review: stop resetting merge tactic trophies or whatever they are called. if its a month its definitely not long enough and resetting it all the way to zero is just crazy for people like me who just dont have the time to get on every day. and now you did it again. probably won't be playing very much if at all now. what's the point of even getting the merge tactic points? jsyk I already gave up on the base game either make this game better or watch it die,1,2025-11-28 06:59:48

"Soo after this latest update, 6 yrs into this game has become all about money they can't handle the updates they put in.. my game glitches to a point they kick me out if they don't want me to win. not sure even if they care because money blinds people but damn guys get it together and quit trying so hard that you don't even know what your doing.. oooh and have the decency to respond to your players especially the ones that have been here so long , ooh wait that's right I don't and won't pay!!!",1,2025-11-27 00:48:37

"came to edit my 1 star review, from one star to one star. this hero update is the worst possible pay to win scheme ever. if your opponent buys the pass, automatically you're facing full level 16, 2 evos, 2 hero's. a single hero can counter a whole push, doesn't matter. had 15k trophies before the wipe, now I struggle to get over 10500.",1,2025-12-08 04:01:43

The players battling against me have all of them and I can't fight them because the cards are legendary. This is troubling me for the whole past week. I downloaded cr in January and reached arena 12 a week ago. kindly look into this because this is gonna create a lot of trouble. remaining cards: 1. Mega Knight. 2. inferno dragon. 3. Princess. 4. sparky. 5. Electro wizard...",2,2026-02-13 13:03:27
I'm a returning player after taking a 4 year break from the game. honestly starting over the new update finally fixed the unbalanced issue of players having way better cards then you do when first starting out. everyone has the same cards in each arena which removed the pay to win problem. Secondly I love that you can purchase items in the game that enhances your experience without making you OP. overall I'm addicted again and the devs did a great job balancing out the game!,5,2026-01-09 21:35:48
matchmaking feels rigged(cards that counter yours appear more often)... their level system is extremely unbalanced and stupid. being beat by people that are obviously worse but just invested more time into the game is the most stupid game mechanic imaginable. playing against people who have a 20-30% all encompassing buff based on level is unfair. i just want a level playing ground... and their modes to support require playing the game immensely oh they also rig the game by lagging at key points,1,2025-12-29 07:14:14
"it's fun but the match making is un believable. How do I go from winning every match to being completely steamed roled back to zero trophies. I have over 900 wins in this account I win when I 1v1 my friends who are way above me and I'm still stuck? Every single time it's like the opponent has the single card that counters my deck. The I thought what if I switch decks mid match, NOPE STILL THE OPPONENT HAS LEVEL 16 ALL EVOS AND ALL THE RIGHT CARDS TO COUNTER MY DECK. unbelievable.",2,2025-12-19 10:20:41
"my friends always told me to get clash so evetualy i did and as a new player i embraced heroes with an open mind but it wasnt long until i realised the big flaws in the game. first of all for a f2p like me it can be very hard trying to climb up the ladder and whatmakes it even worse is the ""ladder"" is a very bad way of making people grind. you can never rest theres always another areana",3,2026-01-31 15:52:29
Honestly this game needs some improvements but in the last few days they have been giving away free stuff such as evos and heroes some matches are also realy unbalanced realy p2w and can take years to grind. Plus remove level 16 theres not a single reason to be adding that. also bring back fun gamemodes in weekends progressing also needs to be buffed at this point reaching level 16 could take 10 years for f2p players. so in conclution buff progresion and the leveling up system.,3,2026-01-13 13:41:13
"why do the developers keep changing how cards work. Whats the point of taking away dark prince's aoe ability.

game is too pay to win at this point. I literally need to pay just to compete with all of these p2w losers. honestly fix your stupid game. I get more gold than cards and that is stupidly annoying.

"Pay to win. Evo shards are nearly impossible to get. you might get one a month if you're extremely lucky. The rise of heroes just made things worse. I could understand paying $2 or $4 dollars for the new heroes. But $15 each is insane. The Evo is roughly the same price. If you want a meta deck, you're looking to pay around $40 - $60 just to get the cards. This does not include leveling the cards to 15.

it's a good game but there a problem to it. 1.pay to win people are willing to buy cards 2. not balance i have seen people using mk firecracker and golem and a lot of matches. like half of the game is either me playing normally or getting defeated by mk 3.bullying half of the people i played with are just rude for no reason i have tried to turn off chat but. every time he gets enabled every time a new update comes out,2,2025-12-15 18:01:15

"Playing this game for 7 years I have 4 cards that are level 15 guess what they do? Make the economy a little better? No. They removed the books ,made cards to be upgraded with gems and added level 16 to the game ofc why not! guess the match ranking is also stupid because I am tower 14 and got 4 games in a row with p2w lvl 16 tower kids.

This games balancing is insanely horrible on top of that you need to pay 15€ for battlepass every month to get the cards otherwise they seem unattainable.

"More rigged than ever. I'm playing my fastest maxed cards with elixir of 3 and under and having my opponents.play double amounts of elixir cards way faster! They never fix it... it's purposely done. Should be investigated. If my maxed out card is slower than my opponent's, and weaker, than the game is rigged and so I assume all the tournaments are rigged. My opponent's know it'rigged too, so they just toy with me to kill me at the end. How many thousand to get souped up cards?",1,2026-01-23 06:51:51

However, the game's progression makes it difficult to progress without spending money, but if you have a few dollars to spare you'll be fine. The other problem with monetization is that every season they add some overpowered card or evolution, charge money for it, and then keep it really strong, so often times whoever has it wins",4,2025-11-10 01:21:13

Worst update ive ever seen anyone who says its good either had max resources to get everything or payed to WIN. BAD STRATEGY GAME,1,2025-12-07 12:07:45
I would rate it lower but I can't. I have been playing for three years and just got back into it. it's so pay to win and it's horrible I can't even get passed my arena bc people are spamming pekkas in arena 2 I would not recommend this enless your crazy or you hate your self. it sucks way to pay to win,1,2026-01-24 23:18:06

this game is literally just how much money are you willing to throw at us if you want to play more than 3 games because after 3 games you go against people who spend money or are pulling elixir out of god knows where if they fixed this and removed more of the p2w features I would play more than 3 games per day EDIT: since the new update things have got a lot better,3,2025-11-25 15:09:38

Its sad what Clash Royale has become nowadays. Supercell is just a money hungry company that just advertise different purchasable items everytime something new comes out. P2W has made this game very annoying and unfun to those who never spent money. . I dont understand why f2p players get looked down on. Everything this game is..is only to benefit the people that spent money. Free rewards to players are soo worthless...only get a handfull of items..never any wild shards..only on bp every season,1,2025-12-19 12:07:02

"This game is low quality and not as like how you see it in the youtube, it's so boring and grind for life, i can't believe that it's not any close to the youtube videos so if you need to go from one zone to another you need to grind as hard as possibly to gain one win",1,2025-12-27 02:28:36
Fix your worst server. In the middle of the match it shows connection error every time. I'm using my wifi which is 150 mbps and there is no issue in my device or wifi but still it show connection error. fix the worst server first,1,2025-12-01 22:01:45
"pay to win stupid game, to hell this game unbalanced, matching making is ridiculous, put you up against higher level players so you can lose and make you want to buy more cards . no, I'm not spending a single dollar on this game and uninstalled.",1,2025-11-29 01:56:54
"since I played back when lv14 was max cards the game was good. but ever since this heros/evos it just seems unfair on new players aswell as high players. these heros are making it harder too. since I have multiple accounts. I've only been able to get 2 out of 4 so far but due to this. 2 evos and 2 heros seems unfair. if supercell want to up the rankings. I recommend 1 evo and 1 hero. (however, a gold hero(knight and musky) should be a choice between either evo or hero. this will make game fair",2,2025-12-19 09:50:14
November 2025 update is a blatant cash grab that has ruined the game. It's just not fun to play like this. I've been playing for years now and have happily paid for the pass in the past... and this update has me on the verge of finally uninstalling.,1,2025-11-26 11:34:58
I see why ppl don't like this game as much anymore I had to come back and add this too t's January🙂 most matches you get you'll be against ppl who used money or ppl who obviously played a lot longer to simply say I'm a lvl 10 going against lvl 13-15 only had it a month and its boring can't even get regular ppl who well don't use money on this game it's fun but boring simply said it's not even match making,1,2026-01-21 23:20:39
"Unfair and Pay 2 Win. Every update just keeps inflating the prices and removing progress to implement new objectives that will be later removed again. It's not fun to play anymore, it's frustrating",1,2025-11-27 14:36:17
hyperbait dropped me from top to mid. midladder is full of people who use the same hyperbait templates and make the game a clicking simulator. p2w dominates the game. I cant progress because everyone is oclverleved. I'm stuck at miners mine for over 3 months because this game is terrible,1,2025-12-27 06:33:42
"Well I changed my mind on giving this game a three star review because this game doesn't even deserve one star because of their ""PTW (Pay To Win) players"" and their over lvl cards and unfair loading time of their cards and my cards. ""Pls do something to make this game much more fair and fun to play not to give an unfair advantage to PTW (Pay To Win) players"".",1,2026-01-22 14:07:07
this game is great and very addictive until you get 5k trophies and then you start to progress slower and because it takes more cards to level up your cards and rng starts giving you cards that arnt it your deck making leveling up harder and harder now im just playing the daily matches every day hoping to level up my cards but I keep matching with lvl 14 players when im lvl 12 this only started recently with I reached 7.5k,3,2026-01-08 07:37:46
"Terrible game, the developers don't care about balance, it's become a cash grab in it's own right, and it's gone from a simple strategy game to a thousand gimmicks which aren't fun. If you don't already own it, don't get into it.",1,2026-01-07 04:10:15
"It all went downhill after they removed the season shop, every update being p2w, every champion being overpowered, unbalanced evolutions, and ignorant developers. They removed books and added heroes which is a hidden way to get more money by making kids gamble for heroes. All in all the devs don't care about the community, they only care on how to get more money. I have 1 last sentence to end this review, rolvo thought they were invincible aswell supercell.",1,2025-12-31 15:35:16
A pay to win game that disadvantages players free to play players and skilled players to cards that are way more unbalanced that they should be. Not to mention the online bullying that is present in the game in the form of emotes.,1,2025-12-07 20:31:28

this will be my second review and it has only gotten worse this is still one of the worse games to be made like bro...after your update how does the matchmaking get worse my highest is level 13-11 and im going against level 16 like WHAT ARE YOU DOING CLASH DEVS????? you made a new level and this has gotten worse the fact that every game has over leveled people is unfair and bad on your part maybe you should listen to your players ans fix this issue. instead of making new levels. can yall listen.,1,2025-11-30 09:28:37
"A lot of the new additions to this game give me bad vibes like this game is trying to become pay to win. Evo and tower troops feel like power creep and cheap. so came back later with double evo, lvl 16, more expensive battle pass, more aggressive micro transactions. Now adding hero cards? basically a 3rd evo? this game is cooked and every game feels worse.",1,2025-11-30 13:04:16
"At this point i'm playing this game just for having fun without pushing too much, i know i can't always win because this game is pay to win.

Afterall it's fun short game that i can play at anytime anywhere, if you like me just download the game.",5,2026-01-26 00:27:53
"It is a pretty fun game, however, prior to the pay to win, it does not show the best results. but besides that fact, the game is still pretty fun for only new players, it might get a little harder when you keep on climbing the ladder, but overall, pretty fun.",4,2025-12-16 07:57:56
"Adding level 16 did nothing for the game except for making it even more P2W. Not to mention heroes are going to break the game as we know it. Hitting the mid range of trophy road as a F2P player is basically the cap, as everyone will have higher level cards and king tower due to them paying money.",1,2025-11-25 05:47:15
"Fino a qualche tempo fa un bellissimo gioco, ora è semplicemente un ""pay to win"". Più spendi i tuoi soldi, più diventi forte e più vinci.

Disgusting",1,2025-12-04 06:33:12
"in all of my 9 years of playing this game, this update is GOD AWFUL....level 16 is honestly a terrible addition to the game and makes everything even more annoying. With supercell lying about max levels, to terrible balance changes. Honestly these team of newer Dev have no idea what they're doing. After so many bad updates, with stupid changes to comp play and not to mention supsercell being even more greedy, im just about done with this game.",1,2025-12-05 21:03:45

Worst most greediest devs in entire android gaming industry. At this point even in game gems is not enough to satisfy their greed. They literally ask for 100s-10000s in money otherwise game can't progress beyond few levels. Game was originally skill based but recent update made it unplayable. Would sue them just to cause trouble for company.,1,2025-12-06 05:00:17
its a fun game to play with all these different charecter to choose from and it is cool to find out different stratigies to win.,5,2026-02-15 04:52:27
I like it because the game is actually skill based ofc there is spending one but you can still have fun by creating your own deck to battle people and I have seen the ads and its nothing like the ads but it is still a great game to play,5,2025-12-07 12:03:29
"level 16 feels like a punishment. I didn't have the cards to get to level 15, much less 16. im glad we got rid of elite cards but it still feels so far away.

yeah was finally getting back in the game but then they added lvl 16 and now im facing people who have cards 3 levels high then mine and I cant do anything about it since they took away my magic items that I PAID for in the past. now you have to spend hundreds to thousands of dollars to stay competitive. im done with this game,1,2025-11-27 05:04:26
worst update ever facing login issues crashed issues everytime game stuck at login page takes to much time to login after every match it's stuck at loding screen had to restart everytime and then it takes to much time to login again it kills the excitement to play the game.,1,2025-12-07 15:07:04
Ive been playing this game for a month and it is absolutely amazing. there are so many cards to choose from and progressing through the trophy road feels amazing. The thing i love abt ts game is that u actually need skill and strategy to play.,5,2025-11-26 09:42:52
"I created a new account and now I have 5k trophies. My tower level is 10 and i literally get opponents who are level 12+. Also you should nerf some cards like mega knight, boss bandit, elite barbarians... and also allow me to get my cards upgraded because i always play againts people who use credit cards. And there is 2v2 mode..... everytime I play i get stupid teammates who use decks which make no sense and it feels like im playing a 3v1.

It was a fun game. Now with the new double evos only for lvl 15 it's impossible to actually win even if you are better as a lvl 14. This game has become p2w and super cell is disgustingly greedy. Edit (2025-09-25) This game is still horribly money hungry. Additionally the matchmaking will specifically put you in disadvantageous match ups so you keep playing. Supercell is shameless. Edit: still a horrible pay to win game,1,2025-11-27 11:15:16
"worst game ever now ,everything is broken only p2w can get only some enjoyment,devs don't care about anything,it takes years to max out a single deck and over that now they add heroes .the balance team is the worst of all they'll make one 1 broken card release so that people purchase it and then nerf after taking the money ,and many reviews are botted to maintain reviews",1,2026-02-02 14:13:22

honestly could be such a good game but it's solely a pay to win game and it makes the game a really trash game it isn't fun when people just spend money to win because they are so trash they can't do anything in life without spending thousands of dollars. Adding on to it after a while this game is getting more pay to win by the hero cards. Mixed with finding they don't care about the players whatsoever. They never ban toxic players and in general never ban people. Worlds shittiest game 0/5.,1,2025-12-14 15:24:04
they have completely reworked the game so that my max lvl deck is no longer max lvl and they hardly compensated me for it. I work very long and hard to get it to that. plus all the books I had that would have helped are gone too. Will be uninstalling due to this,1,2025-11-26 06:17:04
"hey mr developer...are you some kind of psycho... why did you make this game so f unfair...If you invest money , you win...if you buy evo cards you win....and if you don't, welcome to hell...I myself don't have money to invest so if I am level 11 King tower player I expect someone of the same level, this BS game gives me level 13 and 14 player every time... sometimes even level 15 players come....just make the games title ""clash money"" instead of ""class royal""... worst game ever in my life...",1,2026-01-13 16:08:34

I won a game one the next I was met with a 9-year 16 level player with every single card. it is genuinely bad.",1,2025-12-04 23:33:37

"While it's important to create games that make money, they should still prioritize an exceptional gameplay experience. It's clear that the past few updates have prioritized monetization with sneaky changes to reward systems that encourage player spend without an appropriate forgiveness to F2P players. The core experience is fun, but recent changes have been disappointing. Sincerely, a colleague in AAA development and data-driven monetization.",2,2025-11-29 21:40:44
Insane greed by developers. Hard to compete as a F2P player when you have to compete with people who can spend money and skip literal YEARS worth of progress and grind. All of their new features and changes have been designed to create new ways to get people to pay to keep their decks relevant or just to skip the insane slog of slow progression. It's extremely predatory and really frustrating when you realize that the game is insanely fun. Look up videos about this on YouTube and you'll see.,1,2025-12-19 06:54:28
this is the best app ever if you want to play a online game and talk safely. In this game you talk with stickers and you can earn stickers and talk safely online. It's fun and safe.,5,2026-02-03 06:49:44
"King level means alot, every now and then when they are desperate for money they will increase max card level so game remains as pay2win for a year or so untill everyone catches up, very predatory and disgusting imo.",1,2026-01-29 19:56:19
ruined the game with latest update thinking they are helping people by lowering upgrade costs but who wants to play the game when you have people p2ping and ruining ladder. used to be able to actually win games untill my deck is too underleveled with no way of upgrading without grinding out level 11 capped battles or spending a ridcoulous amount of money.,1,2025-11-25 20:49:01
"game has always been p2w but nerfing progression by over 50 percent for f2p & paying players in a game that has always been a slog to level up your cards is absolutely crazy. This is a game that clearly does not care about its players. since I posted the above review it has been a year later and TWO PROGRESSION nerfs, as well as a new level to screw over anyone that was close to getting max level cards. I have never seen a game where everyone dreads new updates instead of looks forward to them",1,2025-12-09 18:11:53
This game was a decent game before they took their ride to fame as a cashout where they could just have everyone pay to win instead of use any actual skill. If you like this game you probably also really enjoy any game made by EA. I'd give it a zero star if I could!,1,2025-12-15 09:07:34
"prepare to hate everyone you will ever meet, btw did I say how greedy and P2W this game is, you and get HALF of some for 6 dollars and the other for another 6, at this point this game isn't even a strategy game. this is all because people will use units that require no skill, this means you are almost guaranteed to lose. people will also use there own decks, I say there own because most of the time you just play someone who just stole a over powered deck this game sucks, I wish I could say more",1,2025-12-08 14:47:09
The game is fun to play when having NOTHING to do. It's my first time playing so i don't know much..

PATHETIC and GREEDY Company who wants to force you to invest money on a RIGGED and UNFAIR matchmaking. Each update is worse implementing new paywalls and an unfair experience to free to play players.. A real shame since it's a game who me personally enjoy.

This game is absolutely rigged... The game play and mechanics are 5/5.. But the Increasing lv.s are some sort of trauma itself... like who's gonna stop that lv. 16 hog rider.. And every matchmaking.. we get matched up with +2 lv over leveled players who obviously bought pass royal and shop purchases... Absolutely rigged.. Pay 2 win...

the game is so fun no adds and u can still win even with our paying its amazing but to be honest I went against people that spawned in units over the elixir limit which means they can't do that I can't tell if its a glitch or their cheaters and also if ur thinking to get the game get it but its a 70% chance u will get very mad,3,2025-12-21 10:12:10

The worst update of the game is that it pays to win the game when you reach a higher area you will notice the gap of level difference when you have 14 level card the opponent sends a max level deck one shooting at card the take 2 spell to kill it only takes one spell. when you log at a princess it doesn't die how do u feel it should be positive trade but end at negative like goblin barrel when u send log it doesn't die,1,2025-11-29 22:57:55

the most pay to win game after the new update. going against town hall 14 and level 15 cards in bootcamp. this game has went down the drain so bad especially after the new update its impossible to advance to a new arena. Will make you want to punch a hole into your wall 0 out of 5 would not recommend after the update,1,2025-12-02 04:40:01
"I tried to return after a long absence from playing. I don't see any option to sign into my Google account that my profile is linked to... I don't understand why they would remove this basic feature or why I'm unable to recover my account. I don't have a Supercell account, but I logged into my Clash of Clans account without any issues. This one just appears to be gone.",5,2025-11-25 07:38:06
"it was fun, but all the devs care about is money Slash Royale, LVL 16 and they have the worst balancing team of all time. They also nerfed lucky chest, got rid of season shop and magic items, I mean I'm trying to look for the positive but there just a so greedy I mean they made 70,000,000 dollars and they made LVL 16, while secretly nerfing lucky drops and adding heroes 0 out 5 till they fix the game.",1,2025-12-16 22:16:21
"This update just ruined the game. Not only it added heroes and lvl 16 which noone asked about, they also removed function that you cna choose whatever the cards you want on 2v2s now its only limited to what cards you have which literally killed it for me because i enjoyed playing this game with friends, after so many years it came to an end",1,2025-11-27 01:30:48
Not happy with the update. Definitely not friendly to f2p players as progression is slowed down by the removal of books. The new hero cards are also absurd to obtain without buying the seasonal pass,1,2025-12-03 20:39:27
"only still have it to triple draft friends. Most pay to win game ever. I get to the end of an arena and fight people who have cards I don't and I have no way to win. Also playing against people who have cards you don't have means you lose, it's fine right? nope, you lose trophies every loss. bad game",1,2025-12-07 07:21:48
Level 16 is top 10 worst updates. They claimed it was a good update for f2p players since you can gem your cards but it has made it way worse. This game is not trying to make it a fun experience they are just money farming. The game wqs enjoyable until level 16 and heroes came out.,1,2026-01-12 17:49:59
"pay to win says the game requires ""skill"". how ever as soon as you swipe your credit card all the sudden you can do what ever you want its like paying money in chess to get more queen pieces. dont download unless you have money I always get softlocked at mid ladder because of this and these new pay to win updates aren't helping super cell fix your game",1,2025-11-28 11:30:18
This application is overly monetised tk the point where I actively have to watch out not to press one of numerous buy buttons. It is a digital store with a game inside it rather than a videogame with in-game store.,1,2025-12-21 12:09:05
"I think that it has its upsides, such as being a fun, multiplayer strategy game, with many gamemodes and ways to play, but I do think its becoming too ""pay to win""",4,2025-12-07 06:44:48
Very pay to win very unbalanced cards not enjoyable at all game gets more pay to win with every update and proceeds to get worse and worse. ive played for 7 years never spent a dime and I cant even get a full level 15 deck and when I finally get 2 of the 8 cards in my deck level 15 you add level 16 and some broken pay to win hero cards. I cant get evos I got evo shards from a chest for a card I already had a evolved im tired of this pay to win game getting progressively worse over the years.,1,2025-12-07 02:37:05
"genuinely one of the worst games ever made, this pay to win piece of trash waste of space on my phone. This game is riddled with in game purchases I'm at 7106 trophies and I'm so underleveled it's horrendous along with how unbalanced cards are in this game from evo witches healing to the absolute mega knight is.

"The people who say the high arenas are hard because of pay to wins are dumb. Sure its annoying but it doesn't make the game less fun. Also, the hard arenas are only hard because clash is such a high skill game and if you just pay, you probably wont get far.",5,2026-01-13 06:15:42
The game was nice before but now the balance of the cards is stupid and makes no sense. It makes the game worse and worse. I stay only because I have friends in the clan. The successive updates delete my decks. it's really painful to play this game...,1,2025-12-01 17:40:28
"it is unstable now, it goes 100% loading then says ""help and support"" when u visit it and come back then game opens and all the time low signal shows but in game it works perfect i mean what the heck issue is with this game ?",1,2025-12-29 13:18:39
ummmm...I place cards and they do no damage. my lvl 12 rage...can't kill a skeleton. tf am I supposed to play??? new update just dropped. in game currency is worthless. got thousands of gems and can't even buy the new Pay to Win cards. they gave me a free giant but that is litteraly useless to me. can't I at least pick the one I want? dont want to sound ungrateful but I can't even buy them if I wanted to so How TF am I supposed to get it Slow. painfully slow. I finished an entire meal.,1,2025-12-08 13:27:50
"I finally uninstalled, it's not a good game. Very pay to win. Progression is ok for awhile until it isn't. If you don't like the cards you've invested in the only option to really change is money. Match making is terrible, it's not a fair or fun experience when your opponent is 2-3 levels higher. Supercell seems to not be able to do this correctly in their games.",1,2026-01-06 23:33:19
"Dude I might sound annoying for saying this but I miss the old clash it was so simple and fairly balanced now there's level 16 cards OP evolutions so many transactions and hero cards it's too the point where it's not even fun anymore, they add toxic emotes for people too use money for the game it's trash",1,2026-01-16 23:00:51
"Better cards means higher win rates, pay to win game. Well good job on the muting part. Still bad mm system, very disappointing that a big company can't improve their mm system(1/12/2018). Took part in the ""elixer capture challenge"" went up against 3-4k trophy player while I'm at 2k trophy. Good to see the mm is still consistently trash(23/11/2020).

This game is really fun. enjoy it alot but ive been stuck at 2522 crowns area for awhile... Everytime its time for me go to arena 9 i play someone who has all level twelve cards and I know they pay to win... Ive noticed a few times when im sitting at 2255 crowns and i win i stay at the same and its frustrating.. please fix ur game and make it where u dont have to que with pay to wins,4,2025-12-01 03:35:16
"everytime I make progress they update the game and my progression becomes obsolete. the pay to win people immediately buy the upgrades and I'm back to losing 7 out of 10 games. ridiculous, so I uninstalled and stopped playing.",1,2025-12-06 01:44:03
"game itself has been somewhat playable, but war matchmaking is beyond horrible. no in-between, either you have a lvl 11 vs a lvl 15 or vice versa. Seems they have no decent matchmaking in place. really kills the game",1,2025-12-14 00:56:02
This game is so pay two win I always encountered higher than my card and the chest literally luck based and pass royale and I bring back the season shop and tokens because it will be much better for all free to play and it so much fun the game modes there and now the game modes are so boring and I will still give this 1 star because the im not having fun of this the game and this developer literally got money hungry literally ruins my fun of this game,1,2025-12-21 05:53:15
game can occasionally be fun however it is purely pay to win. If you dont spend over 50 bucks on the game then you won't make it past 9000 trophies plus there's always bias bandit. there were a few good ways to progress free to play but they have removed them. this is the most greedy mobile game corporation I've ever heard of.,2,2025-12-15 08:23:02
This game is very fun in my life. The best thing is can use a lot of character such as Hog Rider and anything. I also can gain more friend and can release my stress. So can you add more characters and more fun like trio game inside. Thank you. Bye.,5,2025-12-20 18:59:13
"It astonishes me every time I open this game that Supercell literally refuses to properly balance their BEST GAME. Don't play any game made by Supercell. it's more waste of storage and time on ur phone then actual fun. I play Clash Royale but everytime a Mega knight is placed against me I close the game, so am I really playing?, I'll leave that up to u to decide.",2,2025-12-17 17:55:21
"Overall,this game is great.I play this gane everyday and i havent gotten bored of it YET.The gameplay itself is really short so i can play it almost anytime(even bfore my school starts)Im still suprised how they still can come up with content that keeps the game alive considering the gameplay itself is simple yet tempting to me to still play it!The only problem with clash royale is that its p2w .There are so many stuff that you can buy to give you a huge boost in the game.Thats all!",4,2026-01-09 19:58:08
this game sucks and I can see why its dead now 0/10 would not reccomend. Huge waste of time wish I never started playing honestly completely pay to win too. all I play against is mega knight that's level 14 while I'm over here at level 12 and stop adding cards for gems cause it's not worth it pls just delete this game.,1,2026-01-12 00:40:42
unlike clash of clans of u chose to play this game don't waste your money on it because after a short while of playing u will realize that this game is unfortunately riddled with people who use hacks and exploits and many complaints continue to be made daily about this by many but the devs never do anything about the over abundance of players on this game who use hacks and take advantage of all the exploits. so please save ur money for a game that at least have devs who care about the integrity.,2,2025-12-28 04:26:27
"it didn't let me pick the hero , i got the giant that is trash and i have barely used it , i have this game for 8 years now and if you are new at this game just so you know its a pay2play game where the game just makes it so you pay to upgrade your cards and it takes a lot of effort to play without paying",1,2025-12-07 20:04:47
"not only are the devs actively making the game more pay to win ,they are exploiting gambling tendencies and directly pressuring people to spend money. in the new update in order to unlock heros you need to go through 2 separate gambling systems made exclusively to cheat you by giving you stuff you don't want so you feel pressured to either buy it directly for a unfair amount of money or gamble more. If you have gambling issues or are easily pressured into spending money please don't play.",1,2025-12-05 23:25:13
The update ruins the game. Those who pay money will win those who don't will lose. Period. I spent forever trying to catch up with people who had maxed decks and just as I was almost there they drop a new level.,1,2025-11-25 07:12:33
"So, now that you guys have had your fun with screwing us with these draw mechanics. Can you finally change the way draws are chosen for who wins? it should be total damage dealt to all towers. It makes no sense how it is now. It encourages single minded plays like ""just send the hog(s)"". If you take the tower great, that's the point but if both players took the same amount of towers, it should be damage dealt. Other than that, you have a really bad scaling issue. Also, nerf the heroic musketeer.",5,2025-12-12 04:01:44

used to enjoy this game. but now there's nothing but bot accounts and hackers. maybe they should put the millions dollars they get from the no lives that support this game into making sure the game is actually fair for everyone. been playing for 10 years now and they're flushing the game down the damn toilet.,1,2025-12-02 22:15:38

this game is good before the hero update. but after the hero update things got really ugly. too much pay to win players and sweats. this game needs to be studied . this game has too much pay to win shops and they put something that seems op deal stock just makes you regret after that. 3 stars for being good but almost everything is bad,3,2025-12-01 21:42:07
"Absolutely terrible game because please tell me why 80% of the player base had an idiotically stupid golden nugget that is countered by one skeleton and a cannon which costs 5 elixir and not to mention the ludicrous TWO elixir ability that tosses one singular skeleton to the other lane and genuinely, why does it have a counter for single entity tank killers when most players defend it with swarms, not to mention how every other hero outperforms it tenfold. Terrible and abhorrent game, don't try.",1,2025-12-13 18:36:32

money grab game every season gets shittier. had 4500 gems saved up over years and that's enough to upgrade one card from level 15 to level 16 with the new update after they said gems would be much more useful. game has always been pay to win. free to play players this game is not fun,1,2025-12-09 02:47:29

pay to win at its finest. after the added evolution the game turnd into a pay to win game: new unbalanced evolution is added -> paying players uses the over powerd evolution and getting to exploit it and after the non paying players unlock the evolution (2 shards per season if you played enough to unlock it in the free battle pass. so to unlock a full evolution you will have to play 3 months!!) the evo gets a nerf to the ground making it irrelevant. the last heroes update makes even bigger gap.,1,2025-12-01 16:40:29
Clash Royale the game that hates to see you succeed. The algorithm is actively putting you against people with higher card levels or hard counters not to mention the broken evos who are great if you pay money but otherwise they suck. The game tries to keep you at a 50/50 win to lose ratio making it very frustrating to play especially path of legends as I know am stuck in Royal Champ and theres nothing I can do because my high level cards dont match the meta. Honestly I dont see this game lasting,1,2025-12-07 20:02:53

this is a game that has different game modes and a lot of stratagey. although there are p2w options it is very easy to progress through (especially in the lower arenas) without paying and if u can't its just a skill issue because im currently 8700 trophies without paying anything (only been playing for 2 months) the hero level 16 update was horrible though edit: I am now severely underleveled with a level 11 king tower in arena 24 at 9500 trophies and can't win a game supercell fix your game.,5,2026-01-08 05:55:30

this game was good now it has become a cash grab for supercell dont download this game the algorithm makes sure tht if u win three games u loose three games too and hinders ur progress as much as possible which forces u too pay to win and most of the players who pay are paired with easy opponents and the balance changes are a joke they introduce a new mechanic to the game so it becomes meta and everyone spends their money on it the next update they nerf it to the ground. dont waste your time,1,2025-12-20 00:45:36

this game is fun but overtime its getting more p2w like a level 16 hog rider can survive a level 15 rocket. This game should be more free to play because most matches i face are p2w ppl. I hope supercell would also make it less toxic and should make it more easier for f2p players. They should have either keep the cap at level 11 or 15. In my opinion it should be 15 tbh.

2025 and I still believe that clash Royale is a scam. No matter what strategy you call yourself running this game is designed for you to lose. companies like supercell have taken the fun out of video games. The one thing they got correct is the shop. I believe this game should be banned. It's no different than gambling. The new vine spell is $30 to unlock and upgrade to the max level. Scam! In a real video game rewards are earned not bought. bottom line.... this game sucks!,1,2025-12-06 19:21:11

I would rate it 5 star but it's kinda pay to win anymore. I got so annoyed with people paying so muchoney I had to use PEKKA Recruits Gobstein.That might help some of you guys going through the same things. Js fix the pay to win and I'll update my review to a 5 star.,4,2026-02-11 20:52:50
"this lowkey is the best mobile game. but... the company behind is getting to greedy, the game is so pay to win, and thats not all, it punishes free to play player, the progression got nerfed a lot, and they keep adding pay to win stuff like lvl 16 and heros",1,2025-12-21 21:22:14
"Completely garbage matchmaking. Pay 2 win and not even trying to be subtle about it with the battle pass. How is it fair that I cant upgrade my valkyrie to 13 to save my life but i get matched against someone with EVOLUTION mega knight and PEKKA, both at level 13+? or my king tower level is 11 but somehow it's totally fair to face someone who's level 13? Supercell is too greedy for their own good and this game is going to die. UPDATE: still pay 2 win. safe yourself the trouble and DONT download.",1,2026-02-10 09:56:38
"Trash balance. Trash community. Trash players. Most players are kids who don't have any idea how to play, this game is not even strategic when people spam cards or play behind the tower. Also playing 2v2 is playing with brainless people and leaving mid game.",1,2026-01-18 01:02:42
Please dear God. I'm begging you if you see this review never ever ever ever touch this game. And if your friends ask about it tell them it's terrible. God awful matchmaking with overwhelming pay to win stain that makes me question why I ever thought it was fair in the first place. The first 6 arenas are pretty fun and then you want to hang from your ceiling every 3 minutes from there on out. For your sanity do not play this game. Supercell is a money hungry slop corporation.,1,2025-12-03 12:37:11
"The game has been really biased towards paying players for a long time, but the new update makes it impossible to contest in the ranked mode as a free2play person.",1,2025-11-25 02:30:18
the game is too entertainable and joyful. The issue is the game is not logging in recently and the login page says it couldn't login. Fix the issue as soon as possible,4,2025-12-06 20:35:18
pay to play is such a fun thing to do i have spent over 1000 $ it is also so fun that when ever I lose i lose my phone outside that is why it is fun.,5,2026-02-08 07:49:25
"It is a strategy game. Best thing about the game is no in game advertisement. to advance fast you do need to buy, but you can still play without buying anything.",4,2026-01-20 10:18:01
After winning three consecutive games I was within 200 trophies of getting to 10k. I was then matched against 5 hard counters with higher level cards and towers. Of course I lost all of them. I was tilted and decided to changed my deck to avoid hard counters. I was met with yet another hard counter for that deck; which would have been an easy game with the deck I was running before. I lost that game and am now 150 trophies down within 30 minutes. Sorry for trying to play your game supercell.,1,2025-11-24 13:09:31
"been playing for 9 years and just as the game was fun and balanced again they ruined it somehow. This game made 70m dollars last MONTH . IS THAT NOT ENOUGH YOU GREEDY COMPANY?? They added a new game-breaking pay to win feature, made progression more difficult for f2p and added level 16. Why?? The game was perfect. the reworks were great evolutions were good AND made you money. Please supercell fix your game.",1,2025-11-22 03:59:04
Unbalanced and Badly Maintained. Every updates brings more and more pay to win. Unbalanced cards plague the game. particularly because you can just buy the cards or upgrade them primarily through money. every update is a challenge on how unbalanced and pay to win the game can become. Ridiculous.,1,2025-12-07 06:18:07
"games sucked for years but i think this update is pretty much the end for me. already very few actual battles getting matched, mostly i either have no chance or they have no chance. extremely stale meta even after adding all these new tiers of cards, still seeing the same cookie cutter decks with a few variants. most pay to win its ever been with a player base that is encouraged to be obnoxious (guys its literally rock paper scissors calm down).sc makes cards and then nerfs until useless etc etc",1,2025-12-04 10:26:09
"Great add free game. Fun for all ages and a great way to kill idle time. be warned, highly addictive and just all together the best great game out there in every way.",5,2026-01-04 12:40:28
"This game is way too pay to win, I am currently at 5430 trophies and you cannot beat your enemy unless you pay which irritates me alot. Fix your pay to win problems and maybe it will gain some more players",1,2025-12-11 16:41:47
"i used to like clash royale. Was a pretty chill game with not much ""grinding"". Slowly but surely, supercell made sure to absolutely destroy the game once loved by millions of people. the state of the game is probably at it's lowest now, since the level 15 update. please Supercell if you read this (which im sure you wont) stop the greed, and actually start improving this game.",1,2025-12-04 04:06:23
"Clash Royale is an awesome unique game. Tired of seeing the same types of games; look no further you have found the most unique game on the app store. This game is not pay to win, and dedication to it may lead to you playing it everyday with its fast paced battles and engaging gameplay.",5,2025-12-10 04:06:17
They intentionally dont balance the game at all. All supercell cares about is making money. I don't understand why the player base deals with such a pathetic trash company. This game is a prime example of enshittification. If I could give it a zero stars I would.,1,2025-11-26 16:52:40
it is a great and awesome game I love it I've been playing for a while the only downside is that I go against people that aren't supposed to be in my level and I hate it because 90/100 I lose so pls fix that so I don't go against people that are overleveled or just have played for more years,5,2026-01-06 08:40:32
"Money, this game is not free to play its extremely pay to win there is zero reason to play it unless you want to spend hundreds on upgrading cards, getting hero's, and getting evolutions so I would not recommend the developers don't care bout plsyerbase.",1,2025-12-20 03:45:41
Used to play the game a lot. came back to it recently hero and evolution cards are both incredibly p2w and are so unbalanced it ruins the game. game itself also became one of the most predatory cash grabs I've ever seen,2,2025-12-24 21:32:34
Player for many years...you've now made it about money.. gearing it towards coiners. You made us start over when we worked hard to max our cards. The side events are impossible to finish we'd have to battle 24/7 this is ridiculous you've started the downfall of the game. players are aggravated to the point of giving up. you gave us nothing with these new heros! you took away our hard work and starting over cost everything we've done. 💔,3,2025-12-14 23:26:01
"been playing this game for about 8 years, and my word i am disappointed every time I come back. game is extremely p2w and no skill, matchmaking is atrociously poor every single player either has evo mega knight or evo pekka to kill the game before you can even begin. I even just lost my account from the new update and the game took me from arena 19 back to the damn training camp. if you want an unfair,unjust,pay to win experience in a game, this one's for you. fix up supercell.",1,2025-11-25 00:54:07
theres alot of cheaters using third party apps and the don't allow reporting of cheating player so they just get to take advantage of real apying players.,1,2026-01-29 12:23:33
"Great game concept and they executed it very well I will admit people have hyped it up like it was the greatest game of all time, and I was very skeptical at first but once you really get into it, it can be a blast. I read a lot of reviews saying it is a PTW game but I haven't shelled out a single buck and I am doing pretty well. At first it's a bit confusing but once you learn the basics it's really fun. I would definitely recommend it. I would try it out for about a month then go on from there",4,2025-12-06 10:12:43
"This game is a lot of fun and can be so addicting, but it is so pay to win. They have these cards that are called evolution cards, just the regular cards but way more powerful, and they all cost money. it's disgusting how many people buy them and it makes the game unplayable for people that don't want to spend money on it. Don't support them by buying those evo cards, because as long as they are making that much money, they won't care.",1,2025-12-25 04:04:14
"The creators of this game appear to care about money and clicks, when their real worries should be set on their players. A new update that no one requested was released recently, and as a long time player, I believe that they have doomed their fate. People are quitting left and right, especially the people who played for years, including I. I will not play Clash Royale until they wake up and realize how their actions are killing them.",1,2025-11-28 05:16:03
fun game heros seem impossible to really get made I rerolled a giant.... some parts seem very paid to win... but you can grind it as I have but I'm not close to ranked mode after like 4 months.,3,2026-01-23 14:48:42
Very worst network connecting platform. don't install the app. it's a waste of time and mobile data.,1,2026-02-15 09:54:58
"Love the game, been playing for about 6 months non stop and im now lvl 10 in legendary arena with three legendarys and most of my cards at lvl 9+, check out the clan ""#noweakness"" -(11/1/16) EDIT: I still love playing and have played the last 9.5 years almost every single day. But, this most recent update with lvl 16, heroes, removal of the books, etc. have royally screwed ALL ftp players. hands down, without a doubt the WORST update in my 9.5 years of playing. changes to merge were horrid too",3,2026-01-02 13:16:14
Love the game but ever sense the last update when im trying to play on PC my app crashes / screen freezes. Ive lost sooooo many games over this. Its making me want to quit. Will update to 5 stars when its fixed.,2,2025-12-27 07:26:01
like the game been playing for a while. However the constant reduction of rewards makes it hard to play especially for people which is most that dont spend on the game or spend not much,2,2025-12-16 00:01:29
"The game was fun to be honest but this new troop called firecracker is like overpowered beacause the log even can't counter this. Recently the evo of this has been released for that it is now overpowered pro max and My experience gets worse than before. So, the talented worker of Supercell remove this troop or make this troop less powerful. Thank you!!",1,2025-12-17 12:53:07
"awesome game, good to play with others. pay to win is a huge problem. aside from that super cool game. would recommend",4,2026-02-12 23:32:49
It was good until the devs made hero's and level 16 so it's 3 stars if the devs kept it the same or actually made good changes it would have been a 5 star.,3,2026-02-10 05:55:03
"Terrible, absolutely money hungry. what the point of using a tank card when it dies within seconds because of little minions before even reaching the tower no point using these high elixir cards when low elixir cards are better, stupid game.",1,2025-12-01 23:43:39
The game is simply not playable any more from level 16 to heros you guys are just thirsty for money 2 evos and 2 heros is just not fair and not right as most of the player base r f2p my new clash friends can't even play the game without getting smashed by overlevled cards n evos at arena 5-10 u had the perfect chance to change the game and U RUINED IT GREEDYCELL,2,2026-01-04 00:47:28
although the game makes me mad sometimes I do really enjoy it playing with my friends in class has really brought me and my friend group closer together there are some unbalanced cards like that STUPID BANDIT and the game is also a Little pay to win however overall it's a pretty good game especially for local play with your friends I give this game a 8.2/10,4,2025-12-19 05:05:04
"this game is good afterall , I love the way I earn trophies but lose it also😂. well just wanna say that if you're short tempered, it might not be so good for u , cuz I also get angry if I lose 😅 , overall a great game for strategy",5,2026-01-31 19:27:56
DO NOT play this game if you dont want to spend any money renault of greed has reunend the game just need money to win basically no skill day one player that spends money can be at the same trophys within 24 as a player that has been playing since day one.,1,2026-02-12 13:01:51
"the game was fun in the beginning arenas, you had fun and enjoyed playing, that kinda lasted until arena 11, the game was unplayable and everyone was p2w, it was unfair and not necessary when the heroes came out, the game was broken already and at 10k, mega knight, mega knight, mega knight, it won't stop, until mega knight gets nerfed, or there is a big balance change for f2p, I cant play anymore",3,2026-02-02 21:28:00
Been a player since launch I used to have a lot of fun with this game but it's been downhill for a very long time. Balance is wack and monetization is nuts I'm done.,1,2026-01-29 02:38:56
finally gets an active playerbase again and ruins it by adding p2w gimmicks and putting you up against overleveled players. clash seems fun at first but its the most greedy pay to win game ive ever played. dont play unless you enjoy ripping your scalp out,1,2026-01-28 00:49:24
"It is great game to play tbh. But it has become more of a pay to win. Your strategy won't matter if the opponent pays and play with overpowered card. ""YOU PAY YOU WIN"".",5,2026-02-06 12:54:41
"This game is fantastic! My only concern is the game has begun to get pay to win over the last few years, with it harder for me to get to a new arena. I hope this can get changed in the near future.",4,2026-02-10 23:24:46
"(((((((((why am I lvl 13 getting only lvl 15 and up?! also, I be rage quitting too much👎))))))). I think it's an amazing game, that was me rage quitting,my bad, will forever enjoy it but I was getting lvl 15 and I had just turned 14",5,2026-01-31 08:55:10
"At this point,the whole game just turned to P2W.Before it was a fun game with fair matchmaking,but the more updates they do,the more its P2W and unfair matchmaking.I faced up against a level 16 vs me,A LEVEL 12 PLAYER.Supercell is just asking for money at this point.",1,2026-02-05 03:44:18
This game became honestly really boring once the mega knight came out. I average out 90 percent of my games the opponent uses one. It is annoying to only play against the same card every game. and the worse thing is they made the card more powerful and never nerf it.,1,2025-12-08 14:17:50
Addicting but it's pay to win you have to pay for the newsst evos or pay for a new level it's unfair As someone who is constantly getting UC and have made it to the top 10k I can't catch up with all the new levels,1,2026-02-05 22:23:17
"update the game is worse then 2021 way worse then genuinely need to give the game up atp after not supporting the company and qol for the game it's generally unplayable especially as a f2p player don't download no matter how ""fun"" tiktok makes it's seem its all a lie you won't enjoy this game past 2 games I promise you",2,2026-02-13 10:58:21
completely pay to win i even bought pass royale and the now it seems that im not disconnecting from my games anymore at the most critical points like i used to when f2p. pls dont play it watse of time trash game play sum subway surfurs instead.,1,2026-02-03 16:38:16
Years of unbalanced changes left be and broken cards added behind paywalls. Clash Royale which used to be one of the most fun games I've ever played has been ruined by greedy devs.,1,2026-02-02 22:54:31
"do NOT play this, you will get invested and like the game for sure but the devs are so out of touch with the community who plays their game. literally a 10 out of 10 game ruined by devs -10 out of 10 if you include level 16 and heros",1,2026-02-12 00:02:49
Now y'all are doubling down to your greed. recent updates have been very very predatory heroes are basically p2w and progression is still haven't been buffed it's insane how much progression got nerfed since the removal of books and the removal of the season shop,1,2026-02-03 09:44:01
amazing game if you don't have any mobile game must have game have to be good at strategizing but supercell Is a money hungry company which ruins the fun of the game.,4,2026-02-01 02:56:26
It requires updating very often and takes up a lot of memory. The game is not bad but I will not buy a memory card just for one game. If I do not update I cannot play it is boring.,2,2026-02-09 23:17:57
After the last update I lost all the motivation to play. The only reason I still do is because of a free hero unlock. Not a single soul asked for this update. Another progression nerf is also just crazy. Still not being able to unlock Goblinstein and Royal chief because of chest removal is absurd. Do better please.,1,2025-12-04 02:24:32
Last recent updates are the worst. Only the addition of merge tactics was good. Supercell has ruined the old OG Clash Royale game by updating the cards and by removing the elite level (level 15) and by adding useless evolution of some cards. Totally ruined the game 😔. The only updates are good that the seasonal arenas have been added. And this month's update is the worst update compared to others,1,2025-12-01 19:07:56
If you starting in the game its bad because when you people will have more stuff than you and it hard to move up as a beginner you stand like chance the level system is messed up. pay to win.,1,2026-01-16 16:48:18
"Here is the review you are prolly looking for: As a 9 years veteran player, this game is arguably one of the worst competitive games you are looking for. Toxic environment and almost impossible to win without paying. Trust me, chess is simply a better option.",1,2025-12-09 01:42:03
"This game was amazing, WAS amazing. now all it is, is a cash grab! I hate to delete this game since I've been playing since release and pumped well over $1000 into it but, they dont care about players anymore. they're money hungry gremlins.",1,2025-12-11 18:30:20
Very fun challenges my mind. However if you hate and think you can never lose this is not the game for you. Often times you will be stuck because you can't win a fight.,4,2025-12-10 19:22:55
"Clash royale is ruined, absolute pay to win garbage with greedy devs not listening to the community at all. After playing as a f2p for 2 years this is the worst update yet. Grinding to lvl 16 is not fun, it's unbalanced and unfair to everyone who doesn't pay to play. I see a lot of people saying the same thing in reviews but I doubt they will listen just like how we have been constantly asking for the season shop for months.",1,2025-12-02 22:35:30

I had a winning streak and winning continously.One round when I was winning my opponent hacked and made for my pov nothing visible and he placed his soldiers directly in my area near king when I had all 3 castles alive. I love this game but when I saw yhe gacker I thought this game is good it had strong security system.But still it got hacked.So there is no surprise when games like among us were hacked 100 times more easily by hackers.Please improve your security system.,4,2026-01-22 19:01:44

"Clash has never been as predatory or greedy as this, blatantly powerful cards locked behind £15 pay walls, a 50% increase in the cost of the battle pass and unbalanced matchmaking which takes your collection level into account rather than the deck level which makes no sense at all. You can also spend gems to just upgrade cards now, bypassing all rng meaning you can instantly have the best deck from day 1 with no grind whatsoever. Stuck at 10k trophies going against full level 16 decks with 14s",1,2026-02-12 20:50:16
Gmae was good at first. Then at 4000 trophies it's pay to win. I paid for the season pass but never bought cards. This game has turned into a money grab. I dont recommend spending money or time on this game,1,2026-01-23 00:08:36
this is a pay to win game. There is nothing in place to help make this a fair game any more. If you pay you win. I have been playing this game for 9 years and I can honestly say it went from a player friendly game to a money grab by the greedy makers of this game. They should be ashamed.,1,2025-12-12 23:11:19

The new update is bad. Going against a level 16 deck is wild because if you’re not pay to win then you’ll absolutely get wrecked here and there.

"the game is good dont get me wrong, its strategic and requires a lot of skill and prediction. however, my biggest is that the game is heavily pay to win which is kind of annoying due to the fact thats the best way to progress.",4,2025-11-28 17:40:17

tried to get into this game as a new player. the game design at the core is fun but the development makes the game p2w. nothing fun about having level 11/12 cards against people with level 15/16. The grind just becomes boring because the unfair pay walled progression,1,2025-12-08 08:05:11
"I am beyond frustrated with this game. I have a perfect, high-speed fiber connection, yet I constantly lose matches because of the ""red wifi signal"" of death. It’s a total lie—my internet is fine, but the game freezes or lags out at the most critical moments. It’s impossible to climb the ladder when you're losing trophies to non-existent connection errors.

this is one of the worst games and i do not recommend playing because when i started reaching at arena 5 i got a level 13 opponent that keeps emoting so i continue to play but when i'm playing this game for some reason i always get opponents higher than me like 16 or 15 or 14 because i'm just at level 12 still and for some reason i cannot strategize if they sent a level 16 mega knight how can i counter that so this game deserves to die because of how much p2w player and toxic players,1,2026-01-28 01:15:54

lots of bugs now. How ridiculous is this. i Don't think Clash Royale is a fair game now. This game is intentionally matchmaking with higher level opponents which give them an advantage to win easily. i am now completely disappointed.,1,2026-01-29 02:05:42
best game ever I have played... everyone should try it one there should be addition of new cards and arenas also redesign the graphic of the game into 3d like heroic magic duel or castle crush game cards graphics otherwise the game is superb,5,2026-01-28 23:29:19

Have played the game since it came out. It's gotten worse and worse with every update. Extremely pay to win. Install it if you want to throw your phone across the room because you lose every single match.,1,2026-01-29 21:10:56

Disgusting game. At first it was enjoyable but as time went on the game went pay to win. At around 2000 trophies people start rage baiting and abusing emotes to try make you throw your phone. do not buy would not recommend,1,2026-01-23 02:23:06
wish I could give this game 0 stars used to be a good game but these developers of this game are money driven and dont care about the people playing the game. They constantly bring bad updates as soon as the game starts becoming remotely playable for users that dont pay to win. If you want to win in clash you gotta drain your bank account otherwise there is no chance so please dont play the game and spend money to give to these greedy developers and owners.,1,2026-01-22 16:21:32
use to be free to play friendly but now everything is pay to win. battle pass use to be $5 with more value but now its $12 for less and mostly centered around a hit or miss card for that month.,2,2026-01-26 11:02:09

i don't even know why i still play this it is so pay to win and people can buy cards that you can't get until other arenas but no because they can't wait until other areas to get those cards and when you try to get the heros I got the hero chest it gave me 2 fragments out of 200 this game is soo pay to win and so stupid,1,2026-01-29 01:27:27

Great game but sadly it is run by a money hungry owner. Now with everything changed from the recent updates that makes the game unbalanced and pay to win it's just not a very enjoyable game anymore.,1,2026-01-21 15:45:10
why cant you guys just leave the updates on the play store instead you guys make up updates mandatory on the game app.all i want to to be able to play the game and not have to worry about upsater in the game app. if you guys could change it to where only the updates are on the app store then my score might change,1,2026-01-28 22:45:47

horrible actually horrible the balancing sucks and if you go against anyone with a credit card you can't win i mean there is so many in game purchases and if you win you can't after because they will give you the most pro players in the game half the cards are useless and the entire games filled with cycle decks and spam decks they give you zero tutorials for anything if you want to win you have to morgage your house the community is the more toxic than a nuclear power plant I would give 0 star,1,2026-01-18 01:48:51

its pay to win. the developers have never actually played the game to care enough about proper card balance. introducing heros is a slap in the face to people who dont want to spend $ just to stay competative. play 10 games just to go against 10 evo megaknight decks. this game is free but with how cancerous it is i wont be shocked when supercell has to pay reparations in the future,1,2026-01-24 07:43:31
Boring because we do literally the same thing forever and it's pay to win. not that fun. I'd give it 0 stars if I could. I am uninstalling this game forever.,1,2026-01-18 11:12:35
Worst game ever made. Fix the matchmaking!!!!! I have level 12 troops and I play against level 15. Deserves 0 at least honestly. I hate supercell for being dumb like this,1,2026-02-06 06:32:57
Game is a waste of time and effort once you get high enough it turns to bias bs and everyone uses the broken cards in the ladder there is no actual competitive gameplay they BUFF broken stuff and nerf balanced stuff the devs ignore obvious issues and enjoy releasing half finished cards and or busted ones and then buff them more after selling them for 15$ a pop(every hero card they are making completely meta to rake in cash) they won't nerf certain cards or the heros because it makes the cash,1,2026-01-26 01:15:52
Been playing for 9 years on and off and am finally uninstalling. Recent updates have removed the skill aspect from the game and pushed the meta almost completely into pay to win. Was fun while it lasted.,2,2025-12-29 21:08:50
it is a fun game with low rng levels. there is multiple game modes and ways to play with friends also. but that game is rarely balanced and extremely pty.,3,2026-01-10 06:57:37
"I've been playing clash since a long time now, the game simply isn't fun anymore. Heroes? alright fine, Evos? fine too I guess, but the problem is it is painfully pay to win, I absolutely hate playing against players who have a lvl 15 card in arenas where normally it's way lower, it also feels cluttered, so many new features to consider, it was fun back when it was mostly skill, also nerfing the e-spirit?? wow thanks supercell, now I don't shiver whenever I'm playing against an e-spirit player",1,2025-11-26 00:18:26
worst game ever quite an enjoyable game that involves skill until you start to hit high arenas this is because it becomes trash pay to win game where if you don't spend hundreds of dollars it's practically impossible to win. Do not play this game!,1,2026-01-01 14:57:48
"So annoying. I played for like a month and then it stopped letting me play. It says 'check your internet connection' when in reality my WiFi is fine. I don't want to uninstall because I had a legendary. I've left it three months and it's still not working. Don't get the game, you'll get ragebaited like me.",1,2026-01-08 02:59:54
Pay to win garbage. Have been playing for 9 years and the game couldn't be in a worse state. Evo credit card or you can't win. It's impossible to compete against level 16 cards 2 evolutions and 2 heroes if you don't put money in the game. Honestly very sad,1,2026-01-03 08:43:17
"This game sucks now. After heroes were introduced, they became pathetic and money hungry. It will never be as good as it was.",1,2026-02-05 03:55:06
"Don't put money into this game, the prices are VERY steep for very little return. You will have uneven matchmaker games with players who have broken OP cards that you cant do anything about it. There are LOTS of fake bot accounts that spam url websites that WILL scam you of your money.",2,2025-11-29 04:37:22
"Just awful, Out of control matches which are a comlete waste of time if yourbopponentd is 2 or 3 levels higher. The devs are just lazy and focused more on monitisation than gameplay. All of the hard work is undone in an instant with the matchmaking. If players upgradevthat is soon nurffedvso no real advantage. Cant be bothered to writevany more.",1,2025-12-12 20:40:28
i love the game its really fun and good cocept but i feel like heroes and level 16 ruined the game and if you dot spend money your basically at a disanvantige,4,2026-01-30 07:47:42
"Great game, for some reason, updating doesn't work for me, keeps on coming up with an error saying to try again later, and can't play it until update is installed.",4,2025-11-26 12:14:41
worse updates so far (level 16) this is the most pay to win game in history. literally can't beat level 16 with my level 15 cares and level 14 tower. yet this game does not allow you to have 2 main decks it allows just 1 and the rest is impossible to level up,1,2026-01-08 18:55:12
"Great gameplay but awfully monetized, so predatory and with its newest upgrade making the new level 16 harder to reach is hard to stay competitive without putting a lot of money in the game.",1,2025-11-26 22:51:29
"Clash Royale is a complete pay-to-win trash heap now. Supercell has ruined their own game with nonstop greedy updates, overpriced evolutions, and shameless cash-grabs. Nothing is about skill anymore — it’s all about who spends the most money. The game doesn’t respect time or effort, only wallets. I’m done. I’m uninstalling this garbage and never coming back. Congrats Supercell, you killed a masterpiece with greed.",1,2025-11-24 22:03:53
"Its a great and highly-addictive game. I dont why people say its pay to win when you anyways can get the paid things easily through free to play. like the royal ghost evo is paid, I got like 2 shards from an event and I can spend a few wild shards that I can easily get, ir the monk is paid and I got hik through a 3 or 4 star crate/chest. Best part is its ad-free. Great game supercell.",5,2025-11-27 01:13:58
It's a great game I have been playing for a year I still think hog rider needs a hero or Evo tho I like the fact that they added lvl 16 but please stop adding more arenas I've slammed my phone so many times cause of it I like how cheap stuff is especially gems and considering there super useful it's a great deal for a fiver I wish the could bring back books tho it was so easy to upgrade back then if Ur a strategic person this game is for u.,5,2026-01-13 04:56:49
it was fun until arena 6 I was stuck in arena 6 because I keep battling with a player a higher trophy than me I keep losing untill I'm stuck for a year whenever I'm lucky supercell keeps putting the better player with a higher trophy I thought I was battling with a person with the same amount of trophies pls fix it make us battle the people with the same amount of trophies,2,2026-01-06 12:31:54
Horrible game if you are free to play I've been playing for a lot of months now and I am in arena 18 and the amount of times I need to go up against the same mega Knight witch deck is crazy it even boss bandit and tons of people I go up against are pay to win which just sucks the life out of the game completely,1,2025-12-21 00:39:32
"I used to play this game all the time. But they updated it to oblivion and over complicated a simple card game. You know, sometimes less is more. I'll stick to Clash of Clans.",2,2026-01-02 03:26:00
"The heroes are the worst thing ever added to the game ever. The supercell Dev team all must have been lobotomized. It is the only explanation for this update. they only want money, and it has ruined the game. please balance this.",1,2025-12-03 05:09:21
"It's a really good game, but i think supercell is trying to ruin the game and make it more pay to win also if they could listen to there community it would be a better game instead of adding things like level 16 and heroes.",4,2025-12-09 20:28:42
"most pay to win game in playstore, I am on arena 19 still I get overwhelmed by over leveled cards can't even change my deck as it will be more underleveled it doesn't even stand up for 1 star because the new update is rubbish change the pass royale back to how it was the game is ruin for free to play players. Now it's even worse the new updates are thrash. Thanks for killing the game supercell",1,2025-12-08 10:22:02
Waste of time ! Most trash and unbalanced game in the world.they will matchmake you with most unbalance decks just for grow up their play time.disgusting !! Even no player support when players need.just focusing on money grabbing and waste player time.not going to spend a penny on this game 😂 dont even try this utter trash game.,1,2026-01-13 22:20:12
I reached ultimate champion in the game. waste of time. supercell does not care about the community or building a good game. their monetisation scheme is so unbelievably short sighted. They have the audacity to call their game an esport when only 5% of the player base can actually compete in leagues just because you have to have a maxed out deck. spend your time learning a skill that's rewarding and lasting,1,2025-12-04 00:56:51
"I would give it a 4 or consider 5 if this game didn't ruin My game experience of laggy servers, because apparently I have excellent connection like 40-50mbps but I still have connectivity issues mid match especially when it's overtime.",2,2026-01-15 20:34:02
"have been playing for 8 years now, one of tge most pay to win experiences, if you pay the money you are going to have tge max level and best cards but if not you are going to have a bad and frustrating time leveling up.",1,2025-11-25 20:21:52
this game was great. it had cool cards cool mechanics and friendly competion. but ever since they added evolutions it killed the game. then level 15 cards was another blow. adding megakight in the first place was a auful idea. but then to give it its own evo was even dumber. then on top of the pay to win community (Which seems to be almost every top leader player) they add level 16 CARDS for some reason WITH the aditon of heros. just super disapoting to see a great game go. Great job super cell.,1,2025-12-18 03:27:40
the new guy they added to merge tactics it's just plain unfair you have to buy it and then if you don't buy it you just nonstop playing against people who just nonstop. they add stuff that they know people are going to blatantly used to cheat or they know if just unfair. it's clash like dame I want play ppl who actually have skill.,1,2026-01-17 04:03:51
it has a great idea behind it but the execution is horrible. I would NOT recommend it for any new players because the meta changes are what kills. the reason behind the meta changes is the horrible balance team. overall do NOT waste your time on this game,1,2026-01-06 12:00:53
"Man, this game went downhill. With the announcement of level 16, they also removed magic books, as well as removing purchasable chests (used to be able to get for gems) and butchering lucky drops. The decks get repetitive if your in the ""midladder"" arenas.",1,2025-12-12 05:43:10
too much pay to win unfair match up.respectfully get your company a feature in which you lay down on bed and then we uses our power on you and for to access that feature it would cost 999.99$/hour,1,2026-02-14 04:36:26
It's an amazing game but recently it has stopped working. I am unable to login to the game it is stuck at updating screen. I have also tried to re install but still no luck. Device - Galaxy A36 - Android 16,4,2026-01-03 16:20:31
"extremely pay to win, no good balance changes for as long as i can remember, poor event rewards and a very bad pass royale reward system. the grind is not worth anyone's time p2w or f2p. this game is not worth anyones time nor money and most importantly the easiest way to fix all of this is for the devs to get fired!",1,2026-01-08 04:10:19
This game just shows how greedy Supercell can be. All they care about is making money. This game is absolute pay to win garbage. I cant even get past arena 4 cause some morons have freaking evo wizards and evo mega knight. This game is a cash grab and the only way to actually win is by spending money. WORST GAME EVER,1,2025-11-29 03:33:42
"Heroes update and level 16 has killed the game completely, waste of time unless you want to spend thousands upon thousands of pounds. Ive played the game for 9 years, but no longer after this",1,2025-12-31 08:50:04
"The only reason I really dislike this game is how pay to win it is, and the fact that theirs some many cards that take a brain cels to use, this game isn't hard to be good at and some people are flat out just lazy. I like the concept on how you can buy stuff but now the game is just pay to win. It really just gets annoying to play it when people just spend so much money only because their lazy and their not even good at the game.Overall the game isn't super bad but its really just pay to win.",3,2025-12-12 11:13:46
"great game but the game has too many pay to win stuff, and since I entered the 10th arena (now I'm 16th) I have NEVER got 4 or 5 stars, and when I opened the hero chest I got the WORST THING POSSIBLE!!!!! I got 2 shards,OUT OF 200!!! WHEN I COULD GET 200 FROM 5 STARS but noooooooo, these little kids spend their moms money on chests and get extremely lucky. great game but some stuff have to be nerfed. great job supercell👍",4,2025-12-02 03:37:53
at has so many bad things first thing is the unstable connection its keep going on my device and u can't go on the game second is the pay to win but clash royale was pay to win from year ago but now its completely pay to play i hate most new apdates it's such a boring game now not from 4y ago when we used to play with no pay to win and now ppl can buy so the solutions is remove the pay to win things and make gold and gems most valuable and make a new coin for the shop its just all thank you all,1,2025-12-22 03:29:04
I used to be able to build any deck in casuall 1v1 or 2v2 but now I can't. now I have to play trophy rode wich i hate. seriously what happened i miss fare matches. everyone's always over leveled wich gives me a serious disadvantage.,1,2025-11-30 10:28:19
this game is now pay to win with evolutions that when release it's broken and after a month nerf it to suck and waste the players money and the new heros are pay to win also they keep adding no skill cards like mega knight this game very unbalance and the match making is very bad when I play my cards are level 10 and my opponent cards are level 15 and 16 which are the highest card level you can have currently,1,2025-12-31 19:29:41
"it seems superSELL has nerfed progression SO MUCH that they put me with the hard counter to my deck ever single time I play, do not play unless you are p2w, want to kill yourself, or have a million bucks",1,2026-02-09 05:01:39
Was a 5 star game but like most others cash is needed to upgrade quickly to be on an even playing field. Keep adding pay only features. Very frustrating,1,2025-12-30 03:15:00

"downgraded all the way to 0 stars. been playing for a lil and it's even getting harder for me. arena 13 and getting matched up with players who have years and years and years of experience and I keep getting bad stuff from chests. literal goblin hut cards from a literal 5 star chest. crazy right?! recognize how p2w the game is, just got the diamond pass but it is still not good. at the end of the pass, the 5 star chest I mentioned earlier was involved in one of the chests. bad game.",1,2025-12-12 12:09:59
I'm genuinely mad about the lvl 16 update.like playing as a free to win playing is already hard now they gotta drop lvl 16 just to make it even hard.yesterday I played for 2 whole hours just lose to lvl 16 card made me genuinely mad although I might have some skill issues my spell cannot kill lvl 16 card that make it hard to stop the push. I might even delete CR at this rate.,1,2025-12-01 19:50:18
The game is fun I really like the concept but it's just that the micro transactions aspect like 1 time I literally go against a skarmy in arena 5 and even electro giant you wouldn't have gotten this much money without micro transactions i know but you would have a better community without that,2,2025-12-31 11:29:56
"This is solid decent game I mean you get so many options of cards a variety selection for different type of arenas modes for certain types of the year, I mean you even get to play with your friends I reccomand this game, in my opinion best free mobile game out there",5,2025-12-15 08:09:16
"The Supercell team decided it would be fun to add level 16,remove the season shop, add heroes etc, initially making it harder for f2p players.

I hope they will understand what they have done to one of their best games.",1,2025-12-12 19:06:27
"clan war matchmaking is awful, and its system has to be one of the worst. the April update is by far the most worst update, robbing in daylight, not even trying to hide how bad you are treating us. Only the gameplay itself is good cards is good to just that you had to update the game to the worstest possible update, worser than all the other mistakes you made combined, fix it, and you may some fans back. update log with level 16 and a nerf to progress WOW the most paid to win game i seen 👏",1,2025-11-28 04:08:30

"Game is 5 ⭐ but... The latest November 2025 update that came with Heroes is too heavy for older mobile phones. Slow loading screens, can't even navigate through the menu and gameplay is even at its worst because you enter the match and find your tower is halfway damaged. Gameplay lags, you can't know what's happening, by the time it's loaded the opponent is already attacking your king tower. Cards can't even be selected during gameplay, they are deployed 5 seconds or more after being selected.",5,2025-11-26 14:10:12

I am deleting this game after years of playing. just recently they took all of my players and reduced their level to 11. i have not wo. a game since. they say it is to make play more fair but it is really to force you to purchase. i will not. i did in the past but never again. so my recommendation is to find a different game to play. one that is fair to its players.,1,2025-11-19 20:33:40

"Love this game! Clash Royale is one of the best games because it blends simple controls with deep strategy. Every match is quick, intense, and rewards smart timing and card choices. The game stays exciting with new cards, balance updates, and fresh seasons. Clans create teamwork and friendly competition, while ranked play and tournaments give players real goals to chase. It’s fun, fast, and endlessly replayable",5,2025-11-21 00:09:17
"Awful experience. I was playing clan wars and the game literally logged me out for no reason, making me lose the battles even though my wifi is on and working perfectly.

"Easily the most pay to win game I've ever played. You can win every battle you play for you just pay instead of actually being good. Not only is it crazily pay 2 win, but being free to play is impossible. I'm a free to play player myself, and I can tell you that it is almost impossible to compete with people who pay. After they added level 15 and evolutions, it became even worse. It takes years of constant playing to get 1 or 2 decks to level 15 as a f2p player, and getting an Evo takes 6 months",1,2025-09-16 03:07:14
Easily one of the worst games of all time.The matchmaking is so bad since you will always get a hard counter against you or overleveled cards. The game is unfair for f2ps aswell since you cannot upgrade your cards enough for you to stand a chance against p2ws who spent tons of money on the game. Their latest updates are even worse. Its as if the developpers want the game to die,1,2025-12-23 00:31:44
the game is very fun to play and I would of rated it higher but the amount of pay to win this game had is on another level. people can have level 16 cards in arena 1 and that just makes the game boring and not fun to play,3,2026-01-17 13:05:35

this game made me think about choices to win/counter and defend attacks it also helped me realse my anger that was pent up on life on losing in this game. it also entertaned me to a very good spot. without this game i would be very different and a bit less angry but i still love it. Thank you and good bye.,5,2025-11-27 05:06:38
very fun game js hella p2w and games can often be decided by levels or if they have cards that counter your deck also can be a bit repetitive very fun with friends and definitely an enjoyable grind,4,2026-01-18 00:29:26
Was sure reminded quick why I quit playing this years ago. Push about as far as you can until you're playing towers and cards 3+ levels above you to the point where it's about level instead of skill and takes the fun out of it,3,2025-12-10 12:42:23

"The game is horrible. As soon as I got to Area 14, they matched me up with like pros. And I can't ever win the game. Like the game should go like this, based on whoever u win against, that's who u should go against the whole game, like I won one game in arena 14 and then they match me up with a pay-to-win. 6 years of playing. and just a demi god at everything.

This game needs to be upgraded visually. Why would i build powerful pc and want to play a game that only uses a mobile screen on my computer ? just uses a 3rd of a screen. Come on developers give the pc community a treat and upgrade your game.,3,2025-12-05 15:11:05
game is 100% rigged. matchmaking is scripted to make u lose so u buy shop offers. i win 2 games then get hard countered by perfect decks 5 times in a row. skill doesnt matter anymore just levels and evolutions. completely p2w now. used to be fun but devs got too greedy. dont waste ur time downloading this trash.,1,2026-01-02 00:44:57
"I played this game beginning 9 years ago. I left because the content was very repetitive and the only challenge at the time was going against higher level towers. I came back recently and with a week of gameplay, this game is worse than I remember. The introduced evolution is a great mechanic! But for those who don't have a single evolution, you're asking for a beat down. The tower leveling system is also trash. I am pretty sure if the only way to level is to upgrade your cards, it's pay 2 win.",1,2025-11-20 19:47:11

the game is pay to win with it hard for you to play against the other players that have bought higher levels. The pain that is level 16 and hero Knight are what made this game from being fun to a cash grab,1,2025-12-14 18:53:48

"This is a very good game. I love how much there is to do and I have enjoyed it ever since I started playing. However, there is too much pay to win players and it is unfair for F2P players how many opportunities there are to spend money to win.",4,2026-01-05 05:26:14
"Clash Royale itself is great, but the greedy updates and features are destroying what I loved about the game. I wouldn't say recent updates are unplayable, but I wouldn't say they're enjoyable—unless you're willing to spend of course.",2,2025-12-08 21:13:12
"i have been playing for several months,nearly maxed out a deck,but now with introduction of lvl 16 i cant play because of lvl 16 megaknights being near unkillable,no books either,game is barely enjoyable,i used to love it,but now it is just a stupid chore,and heroics who are gonna ruin the meta for a next month",1,2025-11-25 01:57:14
If you want a free to play game don't play because its free to play but its not free to enjoy the game makes sure you can't enjoy unless you spend money which im not going to do on a app game of all things so don't bother and most ppl who play just look up videos and use the same strategy as everyone else terrible game terrible community wish I could give it 0 stars a shell of its 2016 self,1,2026-01-13 12:11:54

"Rampant hacking and pay to win. Not fun, go find a developer that cares for more than there players wallet. after years the systems are better but the game is flooded with foreigners who use hacks decently fun with few hacks up to 5000 then just unplayable with constant games vs hackers.",1,2025-12-07 10:57:42
"latest update should have given you the difference in gold for your max deck to then be equivalent to the new update. Now you need to grind away again to get to level 16.

Been playing for a year now and only have gotten 2 five star chests. I opened my second one today and got an evolution I already had. And got nothing after that. The only way to get things is to spend money.,3,2025-11-25 21:28:31

"played this game for 8 years and it became an absolute moneygrab. every single update is made so they get more and more money. lucky drops are horrible. 5 star gets you basically nothing and its a 1% chance. the shop is useless, the season shop was good but they removed it, progression is impossible, lvl 16 interactions are a joke, no new card releases or evos. heros are way roo op and only avaliable by paying,random hero drops. fix your game supercell or yall lose your money in the long run.",1,2026-01-24 19:07:59
very pay to win based game with a developmental team that clearly does not care about the free to play community with every update being more and more focused on forcing you to pay in order for the average player to actually win and enjoy playing the rigged game.,1,2025-12-22 23:24:56
the game just freeze on my side won't let me put cards down I check the internet and on different phone same problem plz fix this issue I also tried other places with wifi same problem plz fix the game. out of 10 match at least 2 matches won't let me put the card down for attest a min.,2,2025-12-20 06:14:47

"i would give this game a zero star if i can. supercell is literally a perfect example of a money hungry company adding heroes and level 16, are we deadass. Jynxi revived your game and giving you a second chance and instead of utilising such oppurtunities to fix ur game and make up for your actions you decided to abuse the chance and release so many pay to win content. i wouldnt be suprise if this game dies again.

Good at the start but gets boring around arena 17 where it takes lots of trophies and rng to get new cards. also everyone is overleveled for example i went against a person with level 14 megaknight and almost everyone has at least one level 14 card whilst i barely have any 12.,4,2025-12-18 06:33:34
"i had this game @ 1 🌟 after the 2024 update. but continued playing. After this level 16 update, play store should give me the ability to give negative stars. The moron developer who though this update was going to be good, should be banned from all gaming industries. I've been playing this game since it came out a decade ago.

"The new update is very bad and catastrophic. First, at maximum level, they eliminate the accumulation of cards for leveling, now they return to the old system. What a chaotic system!",1,2025-11-27 21:18:04
level 16 is a terrible edition only made to make the game more pay to win also the new heros are brain dead knight is the most extreme example this game used to be strategic now its pay to win and play to suffer definitely do not recommend also most of these 5 stars reviews are botted this games star count is about to plummet mark my words,1,2025-12-08 15:27:21

"playing for 9 years and I can say this game is fun and challenging. my problem is meta decks. everyone has no creativity of cards they just copy and paste what YTers use. 2.6 hog, mega knight and pekka are crazy OP and thats not even the evolution. towers are so weak in modern royale and lack defense that a battle ram by itself can take a tower if left undefended. buff the towers and make splash damage worth a damn cause alot of swarm cards have overwhelmed towers with mega knight in front.",1,2026-01-09 02:30:51

"pay to win. power creep. update: new mode: merge tactics is cool. it's like auto chess. keeps the game fresh. but the newest update is bad because level 16 is the max now. heroes, evos and champions are so pay to win. you cant enjoy the game if your cards are underleveled.",1,2025-12-02 22:10:50
"chalk full of micro-transactions and toxicity, this game makes it very obvious they want your money. Eventually, at higher trophies, it just becomes pay to win, especially with the new update getting rid of books and making leveling even slower for f2p",1,2025-12-21 03:47:41
"This game is not skill based but more of the size of your wallet. Pay to win players get bases with higher HP and more damage, their characters stronger and more HP, and this is not fun.",1,2025-12-07 12:48:11
"have played this game since the moment it came out. it doesn't feel like humans are running it anymore, everytime you add another lvl you never balance properly you just let us suffer. clan wars are ridiculous I can be lvl 13 forced to fight lvl 16 and when we are finally winning another clan just opens to anyone and steals first there's no diversity the only thing that keeps me coming back at this point is to see whats new you are ruining the core of the game.",2,2026-01-02 03:40:13

"Clash Royale is a game I end up playing way longer than I expect. Matches are quick but still make me think, and every win feels earned. Losses can tilt me but they also push me to tweak my deck. Opening chests and leveling cards feels satisfying even if it’s slow sometimes. The game stays fun because new events and balance changes keep things fresh. Overall, it’s one of the few mobile games that keeps me hooked.",5,2025-11-29 18:20:56
No one should play this game. The developers make their money by being extremely pay-to-win and they keep free-to-play players addicted via rage baiting them. If you have the app for 5 seconds you'll agree with me,1,2026-01-06 01:38:33
"Great game that was introduced to me by my friends, but it's sad to see supercell letting it slip away with all the unbalanced updates and paying to win, I wish they worked on evo's more then new unbalanced layers stacked on to the game, I love this game and it shall still forever be a good memory for its players.",3,2025-12-16 13:28:35

worst game experience I lost 1000 trophies even though I had a stable internet due to retry login and Whenever I play new game it gets stuck for few seconds and when I come back I have already have lost a deck uninstalling this game Today if their was a option for 1/2 Star rating i would have given it,1,2025-12-23 20:22:36

I like it but if your phone has little space your done for. this game is well over a gig of space and every update it has will make you delete apps off your phone till only Clash Royale is left cause your OUT OF SPACE . All your hard work for nothing in this game unless you have a 500$ phone.,2,2025-12-21 02:48:45

ok so overall the games decent but there is an algorithm too ladder and I hate it. Basically if you win one match your almost guarantee too lose the next and the next and the next untill you win then lose and lose also if you spend money you win more,3,2025-12-09 11:17:40

Why the hell does my inferno dragon lose connection to a megaknight jump plus i cant lie this game is so incredebly pay to win you cant even play. I have been playing megaknight players for like 13 arenas and somehove they are always max level. Not ones have they been under level 12. Level 12 on the arena u get it is quite much so really dont recomend this game if u want to have a whole phone. Otherwise its great.,1,2025-12-31 21:51:11
why do they keep adding new card levels I'm actually so done with these developers. I was so happy when I maxed my deck out for level 15 but these people keep on adding more and more. I'm actually so sick of grinding i just want to play on a level playing field.,1,2025-12-05 12:49:41
The game is really fun you don't have to spend money but if you do the pass is the best option there is no adds which really makes it a better experience.,4,2025-12-25 04:31:19
its so fun although if you progress to fast like I did you will start losing really often without getting the evo debit card lol. but its super fun to play and once you buy even just kne or two things your all good after,4,2025-12-23 06:28:38

well well well.. here we are again. they released level 16 and added some new ridiculous gimmick with a new currency to boost profits. the game is actually dying and there is no hope for it anymore. don't even think of installing this app,1,2025-12-19 22:25:21
The addition of heroe units that are difficult to get unless you pay and that are too powerful and the fact that the devs ignore the players to me is horrendous. This game just keeps on getting worse and worse. Supercell is just being greedy 😡,1,2025-12-29 00:18:25
I'm honestly sick to my stomach with this game every other march I play it's a mega night player like omd nerf the card or remove it. it's honestly useless to the community the game overall is good but the new updates just make it worse they need to add back the chests and rarity of legendary cards because when I played this game when it first came out getting a legendary was like the biggest thing ever now it's common like this game has honestly turned to recycled trash,3,2025-12-27 23:45:18
been playing for almost 9 years. completely pay to win. don't waste your time. it will put you up against people that you have a better chance of winning for a few games to get you hooked then do the opposite so you have to grind to get your rank back.,1,2026-01-16 05:30:26

One of the best mobile games ever made in my opinion right up there with clash of clans. It's been awesome playing since 2016. It's as close as we'll get to a modern game of chess. You must know your opponents next move before they even decide it.,5,2025-12-17 22:48:57
Matchmaking is unfair. I lost batlle most of the time especially in war because my opponents are always higher tower and opponent's cards max level than mine. Make a matchmaking same lvl as your card level and tower level.,1,2025-12-20 05:43:30
Really frustrating game forcing you to pay in order to get any progress as well as takes away skill from the game overall a bad game unbalanced and pay to win I do not recommend to casual players,1,2025-11-25 20:05:20

I've been playing for almost three years and it is great. But I feel that you should add skill based matchmaking and I get it could be my trophy range but you should make up to 7500 trophies a bit easier. AND ADD BACK SEASON SHOP BECAUSE IT IS VERY GOOD FOR F2P PLAYERS!!!,5,2025-12-13 06:37:10

this game just wants your money doesn't even cair about its player base all it wants is money I went against over leveled people and it just the worst if this game wasn't so money grabbing it would be fun fix your game supercell.,1,2025-11-27 08:29:22
"its stupid, the game gives u the first 10 arenas easly but the second after that your playing agains people who have pockets deeper than jeff bezos and spend it all on this game i broke my finger over this stuff i hate the game but it keep coming back to it, dont play unless you want to spend money on it even then you still loose 30 games in a row then win 1 then loose the next 60 i hate this game",2,2025-12-06 12:17:50
totally trashed what this game used to be. no matter what amount you've already spent it has been reset to ruin all the gains I've paid for throughout the years. you will never get another dime out of me since the game has been ruint by greed.,1,2025-12-02 23:33:37
very fun game that allows you total freedom building you deck no ads but very pay to win you get to a point and you cant win without losing 5 times in a row or pulling your credit card and spending 50 dollars just to catch up,4,2025-12-16 05:11:29
"it is fun,untill you battle the ppl that are full of money,spending money gives players such an advantage that makes others feel like its unfair.the game gets more p2w evry update,taking away a lot of features that made f2p playable,first they took away the chests,then the event shops,then they added lvl 16 and heroes that basically made their evos usless(exaple evo knight).overall is good if you can spend 30£ a month on a ""free"" game",3,2025-12-02 00:25:06

Good game but can get timewasting. Whenever you lose it takes 30 trophies away from you. And you need them to proceed through the game.,1,2025-12-03 04:09:50
ai/yours and the enemies bot is so bad. you want them to go to this tower? well no they will go for another tower or enemy thats across the map like WHAT! there are so many ways to win ill give it that but why should the ai go for somthing not even remotley close to them or somthing with full hp heres a story 1 tower is gone the kings tower is on about 100hp left and the other archer tower is at max hp i put my caed on the side with no tower but the bot goes to the other side to fight the archer,1,2025-12-22 20:49:17
game is pay to win at its finest. level 14 cards and im being matched against full level 16 decks with a 16 king tower and its impossible to compete. im certain the game is rigged to keep you from climbing too fast and make you frustrated into spending just so you can have a chance.,1,2025-12-15 05:59:44
Getting 1 star till they balance out the new updates (level 16 is pretty broken). This is pushing users into paying to keep up and play. I'm really appalled at the profit driven measures this recent update exposes itself and the game to,1,2025-11-25 11:46:33

"Used to be fun but its so incredibly pay to win now and card evolutions made it even more so. Insanely hard to get card evolutions without paying, not to mention card evos are very op so if you dont have good ones it is much much harder to win. Now they added level 16 too 🥀",1,2025-11-26 01:40:01

The game is amazing my only problem is with the pay to wins like I was close to 6000 trophies but I matched 3 pay to wins at once making me rage someone who doesn't want tons of money on the game and it's not even like small changes it like level 13-15 cards while I am on 10-11,4,2025-11-26 18:57:13

The upgrade cost was not changed or made lower the games lucky boxes give you worthless stuff instead of getting a new card they give you gold or a banner the new upgrade makes the game so pay to win being able to pay gems to upgrade a card is stupid now every few matches your fighting someone overleved I lost so many times because my opponents cards are 4 to 5 levels higher,1,2025-11-25 23:20:43
"Yeah, this game dominates all other Supercell games in my opinion. But, the only thing I have is the matchmaking. Seems a little frustrating, when you get paired with people 10x better than you. But maybe that's just me. And my luck of getting no legendary cards.(2/3/17) EDIT: I've still stuck around this game. This new update is GARBAGE. Level 16? Remove Elite Cards? Reimburse NOTHING that you've been using? Thanks Supercell. I hope you get a Level 16 Mega Knight to the dome.",5,2025-11-26 02:11:34
one of the worst game when it comes to internet issues. and it's funny that happens just when you're playing against ( pays to win) if you buy the pass royale Oh now your internet problem is solved.,1,2025-11-26 20:01:34
good game but its not fair.. my cards is level 3 and and 2 and my opponents have 6 and above??? after 5 years i try to play again but its the same.. card is balanced but the level is not. i am level 9 and then i have to face level 10 with greater cards and levels hahaha,1,2025-11-26 21:25:06
I'm around 7k trophies I've spent less then twenty dollars on this game and I have every card peopel complain about pay two win too much (I did p2w) but it's not too much of a problem I would go against people with cards three levels ahead of mine and still win if people complain it's because either their deck sucks or they aren't playing as well as they can edit: I'm ten k trophies now lol,5,2025-11-27 05:21:14

"Between loading issues that cause losses, pointless updates, meaningless upgrades, and players who act in very unhealthy, irrational ways, Clash Royale has lost its identity. The game feels less about strategy and more about who pays more.",1,2025-12-27 16:59:48
hey Devs. light bulb... how about giving us challenge bubbles for each game modes.. like crowns for 2v2s and megadraft etc... so much to collect and not enough options of collection...does this make sense? not being rhetorical or sarcastic i promise. Just when I started out it was so and 9 year here spent money level62 lvl15 tower...... lvl 15 cards . emotes and all.... give us more missons please and thankyou,5,2025-12-09 07:08:01

Really fun game that updates a lot. only thing is its pretty pay to win and there is a few overpowered cards. Anyway I love this game and suggest it to anyone who likes strategy games,5,2026-01-05 09:34:01
"evolutions, level 16 , the gatcha system to unlock heroes have ruined it for me.... the heroes themselves are..... I feel like are good ,but the way you unlock them is so tedious and frustrating and don't get me started on the level 16 and evos",1,2025-12-08 20:46:49
best game of all time most people will be pay to win but you got to deal with it at some point. it is a strategy based game the only thing that matters is to take there king tower and come out with victory,5,2025-12-12 23:37:19

This company has bait and switched its players every 2 years, just released lvl 16 after saying they would stop at 15 and made it so the only way to get cards to 15 was getting all 121 to 14 so everyone spent all there resources while behind the scenes they planned this and made getting to 16 cost 5x as much money. Doubled the price of the battlepass then nerfed it by 80% look up youtube videos.",1,2025-11-25 23:56:24

every update they either go for the money or make the game unplayable for anyone who tries to go F2P. Every single update made the game somewhat worse and even if they make something better there is such big downgrade that it's unplayable you can't have normal game without meeting someone who's OL as hell or has everything maxed right after new update came out which totally killed the game and made it garbage and P2W,1,2025-12-01 02:33:47
Reason 1 too pay to win to the point where if you want to max a deck it will take hundreds of dollars Reason 2 Clash Royale bots their reviews Reason 3 Releasing broken cards that cost $15 Reason 4 promotes toxicity Reason 5 Progression is way too hard for free to play players Reason 6 Every top player you see has paid to reach where they are,1,2025-12-30 23:52:51

"Clash Royale is a 10 out of 10 game although many people call it pay to win, tbh I don't agree. Clash Royale gives you a lot of chances to get great free evos and chests (they literally just gave out Evo Hunter 100% free.) I am in arena 18 and I strongly believe it is very skill based. Because many people who pay to win are usually trash at the game so even though they have better cards they are lacking in the part that matters the most, skill.",5,2025-12-20 23:28:09
In order for supercell to make the game worse for f2p they : 1-cut the battle pass rewards by more than half 2-removed books from the grand and classic challenges 3-removed the season shop 4-removed the daily streak rewards ( which i benefited from the most ) 5-nerfed both the lucky drops rewards and the chance for them to level up Edit: they nerfed lucky drops even more and added lvl 16 and heroes.,1,2025-12-29 01:13:15

matchmaking is trash. Why am I going against other players whose level is much higher... took time away from this game to come back and be even worse than before. The amount of pay to win is crazy.,1,2025-12-31 20:55:30
The game is overall just very pay to win. This game does not need any tactics if you have the best card in the game. The card I am talking about is the credit card or debit card,1,2025-12-30 05:19:48
great game but the devs are incredibly annoying. It would be nice if they made the weekly challenges more interesting and fun. it seems like the devs only goal is to squeeze as much cash out of you and as a player who buys the pass each month it's very frustrating. update: na screw this game don't play it,1,2026-01-07 11:18:10
worst pay to win game you can't win unless you spend money to get your cards max level this game is going to die also please rework this whole chest system it's not very good it gives horrible rewards and it's almost impossible to get evos out of them or anything good,1,2025-12-19 11:44:42
endlessly milking us. never will you own a full version of this game no matter what... they keep moving levels up and at the same time your account isn't worth anything. endless hours of gaming and you can never show a maxed account for it because they keep adding levels andcharacters and features... how do you keep up without spending money and never really owning anything real... like real life badges? this is really sad because I've got nothing to show for it.,5,2025-11-28 14:31:14
supercell/clash royale please explain i took a screenshot of this my mini pekka destroyed his tower in over time so the game ended right but no the game glitched it zoomed out and the opponent's characters just continued and broke my tower and he won he does that work and his tower spawned back.....really angry about this,1,2025-12-28 23:00:02

this is the best game ever when it comes to strategy. sometimes the mirror ability glitches and if I used log and then mirrored something else. it will show the log but use the other thing. but if you don't install than you should go play brawl stars or smth,5,2025-12-19 20:12:35
"So far CR has been 100% glorious card based tower battle fun with zero issues. In an era where 99% of mobile games have some attribute that ruins enjoyment, CR is a much appreciated standout. Colorful and relaxing while providing strategy thrills, CR has an amazing array of cards representing fantasy adventure archetypes some of which work together better than others and all of which help make CR the excellent game it is. And it's kind to players who aren't made of money. In short, CR rocks!",5,2025-12-02 07:33:53
"I just can't anymore. First Supercell introduces lvl 15 which NO ONE WANTED. Then completely 180s and introduces lvl 16, destroys the gem and gold economy (2.5k gems to level up from 15 to 16).

Do champions not exist anymore?",1,2025-11-25 08:00:21

Been playing for almost a year and a half and I am doing pretty good it is not that hard people make it sound like the hardest game of its time and actually it is pretty fun. Edit I am stuck on the same arena for the past 3 months I get to just one game left I get matched up with a mega knight pekka spammer.

One thing that is a bit annoying is if you start winning they put you up against unrealistic counter decks that absolutly destroy you. But other then that it is a great way to interact with others and have fun😁,4,2025-12-10 13:29:44
this game is one of my favourite games to play i was stuck at 7000 trophies because i was under level but when i spent over 600$ i was at 9500 trophies and you sould not be able to spend so much money on a kids game so thats why i give it a 4star,4,2025-12-31 20:37:20
came back after a few years off. the game is 100% pay to win and pay to play. Eeveelutions are a cool idea but the way to obtain them for returning or new players is a bit ridiculous,1,2025-11-24 21:04:56
a completely rigged matchmaking system that changes opponents cards based on your deck. try it. change your deck and see for yourself how you'll find opponents using cards you've never seen before.,1,2026-01-09 23:06:02
Love this game great mechanics and display.Only thing i would say is that it is very pay to win as most of the items in the shop are bought with real money.,4,2025-11-26 15:46:14

Most cards I. the game gets too nerfed to even use then and then there're delayed cards that completely miss what you want it to do.Also it's mainly pay to win to get up in arenas by getting higher level cards or getting early cards your not supposed to in lower arenas.,3,2026-01-09 08:37:04
All the ridiculous evos are killing this game. 80% of the decks have Mega Knight or The Witch. And of course most players only use the hog rider among with them. Skill and strategy are no longer things you need to be successful.,2,2025-11-30 19:58:00

"Clash Royale often feels unbalanced because cards like the Witch can become disproportionately powerful at higher levels, and pay-to-win players can upgrade them much faster, amplifying that imbalance.

I love the merge tactics game....... 2 v 2 are based on what Ur current troops levels are again..... 100% one of best game on phone........ keep it up..... keep the epic visual up.........,5,2025-12-28 07:44:35
"I've been playing this since 2018, and this game was low-key heat. But whoever decided to add lvl 16s, heros, and removed season shop. Pls leave the company and supercell pls fix ur game. This game lost its heart and soul when u guys chose money over the players .💔 💔💔",1,2025-12-18 14:47:32
"The recent updates are just money grabbing, so many in app purchases that are such a waste for what was a good game, that showed strategy over buying to win.",2,2026-01-06 16:29:47
"terrible new update, can't spam meganight in 1v1's anymore because I haven't discovered it yet. No point in playing against people who are higher arenas than me and spam cards that I do not have the ability to use. fire your employees.",1,2025-11-28 01:19:04
clash royale is a super fun game but it has it's ups and downs for example the higher the arena i go the pore pay to win the players get and sometimes i feel like im going to quit of how annoying MEGAKNIGHT can be but overall a really good game,4,2025-12-09 02:28:23
"Don't let your kids play it, it's made to be very addictive, a lot of worthless clicking to make you even more addictive and it's not honest game, not worth your time, a lot of bots.",1,2025-12-20 16:51:47
"Ladder is slanted heavily towards the pay to play players. This game is only fun to play against friends. Otherwise, it's a complete waste of time. P.S: the player-base is very toxic.",1,2025-12-10 22:53:38
truly an experience for the ages where no matter how many years of effort you put in the developers always find a way to screw you over. money hungry garbage devs. Game is fun.,1,2025-12-03 04:02:00
"New Update sucks, taking away books etc and not really adding anything useful, not a fan of heroes and also adding buildings to merge tactics, the buildings are absolutely broken/OP.",3,2025-12-16 09:53:49
Supercell made a huge mistake making lvl 16 and making card upgrades available using gems. Supercell is way too greedy and every match is against lvl 16 cards now. I used to enjoy the game before lvl 16 update but now everything is pay to win.,1,2025-11-25 08:47:24
"level unbalance, do you know it's very uneasy for a normal player to maxed level their cards, you makes this game like only rich man can win easily😢, it's not the only way to earn profit, you just make this game lost it's own meaning",1,2025-11-24 21:54:48
pay to win game algorithm won't let you go above a certain trophies if you don't purchase item using money 0 star deserving please don't waste your time and doenload some good game,1,2025-12-24 22:00:14
this game is absolute garbage i thought this game would be fun but every game i run into a weirdo who hasnt showered since this game came out using the weirdest and most annoying cards and combos in the entire game.,1,2026-01-03 23:13:36
"The concept of the game is amazing. However, with every update it gets more and more pay to win and they are taking away everything that is good for the players. For that sole reason, for me it deserves 1 star.",1,2025-12-16 18:43:07
it's a good game been playing for over 5 years. BUT. P2W is out of control. greedycel makes players with cash stronger than the weak convincing the weak to spend money to be strong like the strong. I just can't play this game this way.,2,2025-12-15 12:07:04
"this game is amazing and I love it but fix the card gems purchases. Players shouldn't be able to buy cards with gems cuz I'm getting spammed with p2w players, instead you should get rid of the purchases but keep the system for filling up cards with gems",4,2025-12-06 23:08:17
The reason why I chose this beacues you have to spend lots of money just to get 1000 thophes and they give you lots of pay to win players so do not play this game and this game is not freee!!!,1,2025-12-30 23:10:03
I used to play this game a lot and was in arena 13 but when I came back 3 years later I'm in arena 12. This would be fine with me except for the fact that everyone I play against has dagger dutchess and I don't. It says I need cards but I'm not sure how tot get those. -_- my only complaint is so make getting cards easier. EDIT: ITS TOO P2W,3,2025-12-01 08:37:07
"Thank you for everything you have done . But,The new update is terrible! bring back the old UX/ UI of navigating the decks and drop menus. They are very ugly, meaningless and confusing to use. Please fix",3,2025-12-15 22:46:46
"No way would I pay what it would take to compete in this game. Tried again and this game got worse. when is enough, enough? For those fools that pay into this and I'm not talking about a couple of bucks here and there there is no point to the game.",1,2025-12-20 09:21:55
It's the best game ever! but the thing I see is I keep getting coins on star 2 lucky chest which I don't even get a card it's just coins. Am Level 10 Only Musketeers and other it's 11 Level Mini Pekka.,5,2025-12-26 12:51:16
"it's great all is good, but there's a bug where if you load into a battle and hold your screen( I was scratching something off my screen) it will keep the banner up( for players with ADHD this can effect the whole game I got distracted for like 20 seconds and -3000 damage on my tower lol)",5,2025-12-03 08:21:19
"cluttered game, lots of things to do bad balancing each update is now introducing new money sucking new mechanics and upgrade in a already cluttered game real issue of overpowering some cards more than others rarity doesn't mean anything elixer cost doesn't mean anything",1,2025-11-24 22:43:43
Fun game to play with friends but the new hero cards are killing the game. Hero knight is so broken it doesn't have a weakness in the card info video clip. the card gives you free confirmed hits on your tower.,3,2025-12-07 02:42:34
"this game has fallen in f2p playability at an all time low (u can say the same thing every game changing update) with the level 16 update, you basically killed f2p progression when you nerfed chests and took out books. Heroes is another thing ruining the game, being a no cycle stupid good card alongside evos, I can only imagine how horrible the f2p players will earn heroes.",1,2025-11-25 19:01:32
"latest update ruined the game, just added more for you to have to buy, I had 16 cards maxed out now have to pay another 20 dollars a card to upgrade to 16... greedy developers killed the game once and now they're killing it again... good riddance",1,2025-11-25 00:38:34
"The game is good, but i am f2p so it's kinda unfair especially for those who spend their money in the game, i mean it's reasonable that the company of supercell wanna make a profit but the gap between two players is so far but still a good game though.",5,2025-11-28 20:25:58
"the game used to be an awesome game to play, but it is pay to win, and certain cards are ridiculously hard to play against. It's very hard to level up cards also",1,2025-12-12 08:15:05
this game is super fun and a game that isn't easy. you really have to grind. I'm a free to play player and I'm still winning so it's not impossible without spending money,5,2025-12-26 16:54:04
"Level 16 was so unnecessary, clearly just a cash grab. Every good part of this game has been removed or locked behind a paywall. The devs are killing the game with their greed.",1,2025-11-27 06:30:30
I love this game but for all Good in the name of Jesus Christ almighty our Lord and savior who shed his blood please add daily challenge tab and a progress tab with reward that is a story mode so people who don't have all day and all funds to actually have access to a fun time I love you all and this game please take my review into consideration. also do extra gold for using a certain combination of Cards as a challenge. Also another idea is add an Ai to overview each game and reward forclutchs,5,2025-11-27 05:51:12
This game is only fun if your willing to spend hundreds of dollars a mouth used to be more free to play now if you don't spend money you basically can win and thus don't have fun.,1,2026-01-12 14:51:40
"it's a good game but there's a prevention that needs to be added, where the characters from areas that you haven't gotten to, not allowed to be used in areas lower and I kept seeing megaknight in jungle (pay2win) and that needs to stop, but overall it is fun to play",5,2025-12-19 05:46:15
"pretty fire game if u ask me but the one thing that I've had problems with is.....when you roll in chests you'll get stuff don't get me wrong my archers r level 15 but when it comes to legend and cards like mega knight it's practically impossible and kind of ticks a person off when they get a 5 or 6 Star chest to get nothing good, like earlier I got a 5 start chest and didn't even get a legendary.",4,2026-01-04 17:38:21
absolute paywall. dont expect to climb without spending money. constantly put against high level enemies to force a loss. I quit every second game because enemy is so much stronger. regret spending money,1,2025-12-18 16:06:01

supercell just halved progression and took away in game content. this is the worst game I've ever played. update: they just halved progression again. I wish I could take away stars as 1 star was far too generous.,1,2025-11-30 07:10:21
Clash Royale is a very fun and amazing game! it has cool and nice features! and I love how you can play with your friends cooperatively and competitively! I introduced my cousin to it and he loved it! everytime I visit him he tells me to play with him! and I love how each character has unique abilities,5,2025-12-20 16:02:15
"Scam game. how can a GAME require you to spend money CONSTANTLY to win? 9 year player here and I can assure you thus game is not worth it. they just want your money, they dont care about making a new game",1,2025-12-04 20:02:26
"Useless & Frustrating game if you don't spend money. Absolute Pay to Win game. No need for skill or any ability, just use money, buy items to destroy every opponent 😠",1,2026-01-03 18:14:51
I've had this game for quite a while on different accounts and it is such a game never had one problem with it and like the 9 years I've been playing it's super fun super easy it's fine you can go against your friends you can make clans you can make friends I love clash ❤❤❤❤,5,2025-12-15 02:18:15
changing my rating. used to be 5 stars. this game gets worse for the consumer and better for supercell with every update. it is almost purely p2w and it breaks my heart and i know thousands of other people feel the same. ive had my clan member delete the game. worst update to any game ever. supercell doesn't care about strategy but who can afford to have certain cards and levels. the f2p grind is almost impossible now and take YEARS TO BUILD 4 TOP LEVEL DECKS. UNLESS YOU P2W.,1,2025-11-29 02:37:32
very very good i spent over 108 hours on this game overall and is very helpful with statergies and its very good and i like it and i think if you play i think you will also like it and will spend the same hours like me even my mom told me that i play to much of this game. Very very good i like it I will play it every day and im like addicted to it i cant leave without the game and the first day i started was in october 2025 and the time im writting this on December 5 on 2025 which is not long..,5,2025-12-06 05:57:35

came back after a few years to play again. half of my stuff is gone including cards and emotes wich as a free player was hard to get. i guess i just made a bad decision to come back,3,2025-11-26 19:53:44
"This game was incredibly fun in the beginning, but now I realize most of the enemies are just a bots. And every 5 seconds the game keeps on disconnecting me so I keep on losing my rounds and trophies and cannot advance even fighting bots. Get your game together, Supercell",5,2025-11-30 01:01:11
"the latest updates make a great game a real disappointment to be a part of... the ingame economy is hosed. all reserves you may have had are meaningless now. I love this game. one of the all-time finest battlers. but bad choices, and the incoming AI content flop",2,2025-12-01 03:52:37
this game if you dont want to spend money you have to play it 24/7 sacrificing your life and your soul but if you use money everything becomes so easy because you have everything overleveled if you use everything on a singular deck and i hate it because i have money but i dont want to spend it on a stupid money eating mobile game and they keep overdoing by adding more p2w stuff and they keep making harder for f2p players and emotes are just worse because why would they add a twerking pig and etc,1,2026-01-06 06:08:18
I used to absolutely love this game. been playing since 2016 as proven by my 9 year account badge and it is just sad to see how much they ruined the game and made it a literal pay to play game. screw the devs at supercell who allowed this to happen,1,2025-11-28 08:46:53

Hey devs I'm just gonna be honest here.. The problem I have is that my opponents have way better cards than me (at 10500 trophies I have level 14 cards while they have 15 and 16). progression is drastically slow now and getting gold is very difficult as now the main source of gold might be from the daily lucky blocks. I spent all of resources getting some cards to level 14 and 2 cards to 15. how am I supposed to get a viable deck if my cards have bad synergy nd underleveled js what am I gonna do,2,2026-01-02 13:01:59
"It was fun, but each update is worse and worse, in terms of progression and respect for their own players, pay walls are excessive at this point and almost feels like a scam.",1,2025-11-25 10:24:14
Extremely pay to win. The new level 16 system and diamonds we earn from maxed out cards are completely useless. I don't care about emotes and always keep them turned off. The amount of frustration from this change is unreal. Supercell greed is getting out of control.,1,2025-12-12 22:00:16
Tbh I left about 6 months ago due to lvl 14 and other updates and now it looks like it got way worse do not get this game get brawl stars for a more f2p friendly experience. edit well I came back a few months ago and now lvl 16 is out time to pack it up again why did I come back. no idea,1,2025-11-24 21:54:52
used to be fun but now you can temporarily make your cards retarded OP for a match which is stupid. I liked it when I first came out when you actually needed skill. The money system is way too inflated now too.,3,2026-01-08 23:06:08
Its going great but there is a glitch now. The skeleton King or other champions i dont know who can't use their abilities. The skeleton king wont collect souls and wont get any value out of his ability please fix this,4,2025-12-02 04:22:49

the game is so unfun at this it was so much fun but then they ruin it with how pay to win it all is and plus the progression system is so bad its hard to level your cards up so you have level 12 cards going up against level 15 and 16 cards,1,2025-12-22 06:29:06
"This game is completely pay to win, the progression is terrible and instead of balancing cards or nerfing overpowered ones, they just make more quick cash grabs by releasing heroes, level 16, more evos, more heroes, nerfing lucky chests.",1,2026-01-05 19:23:36
this game is so pay to win it just gets sad. if you are free to play it is a really hard challenge to get past people who pay for this game and it normally just makes me quit after the 5th person in a row,1,2025-11-25 22:26:16
"being able to play with your friends is what make a game popular, needs a better friending system and maybe a lobby to add friends is really hard compared to brawlstars and other games otherwise I would give it a 5star please do something about and",3,2025-12-25 15:34:02
"THIS IS A 1 STAR GAME ONLY REASON I PUT 5 IS SO YOU GUYS CAN SEE THIS REVIEW!! This is actually the worst case of pay to win in the history of gaming. If your trying to find a game you can enjoy on your free time THIS IS NOT IT! And if you still download the game, expect to always face p2w people that will always be double your lvls so 2 of there cards can clear your whole deck and tower. What a Joke! No wonder this game lost most of its player base. THE GREED FROM THIS GAME IS SICKENING!!!",5,2025-11-29 01:03:43
"keep updating the game so its impossible for free to play players to play competitively, finally upgraded my cards in a way so i would get more elite wildcards to get lv 15 on more cards, then the changed the way to upgrade your cards so i have upgraded a bunch of bad cards for no reason at all",1,2025-12-12 21:52:14

played it for quite long time but the game seems to downgrade the cards i use if they want to add new cards its ok but if a person achived max level of card which take a long time do not downgrade it first they downgraded giant skeleton now skeleton king its a good game but i do not know why developers do this,1,2025-12-05 01:34:17

"very fun and time-consuming while not being a game that gets boring after a while but clash royale pls add a new pass royale, my only complaint is how p2w the game has become and me as a f2p player it becomes a chalenge to deal with the players but overall it is a really good game",5,2026-01-02 16:21:06
It is so bad i play every time i spend a bunch of money and when i was close to 10k trophes the game decides to give me the best players and went all the away down i am never playing this trash game i hope u guys never play they only care about money,1,2025-12-14 13:23:01

After the new update the resources you earn by playing are way lower and they got rid of the chests that you can buy with gems. The game is now much more slanted to paying for coins and upgrades.,2,2025-12-27 00:30:13
You think you are about to get a new arena and nope you lose every match for 10 matches then repeat. On top of that tho you need to be a certain level to get into certain arenas and it is super pay to win lvl 16 ruined the game,1,2025-12-06 12:42:11

very bad game . Don't install it .when you grow up that time they will matching you powerful player . when you win they give 29 trophy and when you lose they tame 31 trophy .it's a worst geme I play .,1,2025-12-11 15:59:18
"Honestly, this is the best game on the mobile market right now. Too bad the devs would rather sell out their entire fan base for a quick cash grab. Such a shame to see it like this.

I can't believe the updates still keep getting worse. You add stuff but fix nothing. why even play when everyone is overleveling. soon enough the only players will be pay to wins and after they realize that they will give up to making this a dead game.,1,2026-01-11 11:02:49
Always updates rasing the level cap or adding p2w bs you need to buy or get rest by it. Level 16 was the worst update in history of the game. Especially for long time players. They make it increasingly hard to upgrade cards.,1,2025-12-13 03:56:55

"Just thousands of people playing the same hog spam deck. You know exactly what deck the opponent has based on a single card placed.

"Super spammy game, intentionally manipulates kids into in-app spending. Shouldn't be allowed in games marketed to youth. Shameful.

very worst when compared to two three years before game is good . only who have money to upgrade they play well. somee have over power but they reduce which need to give power. game getting more irritating,1,2025-12-02 03:53:57

love the game one of my favorites but I don't know why this game is like so pay to win. it took me like 3 months to gather enough resources to max out a single card and the evos.. they're like impossible to get you'll get 2 from the pass royale every month and one or 2 occasionally from the drops of you are lucky. it took me 3 whole month to max a hog and get a Evo musketeer. in new update they claim to be f2p friendly but they made it even worse,1,2025-11-26 16:02:43

updated review: The developers have lost touch with the fan base. they operate on a cycle of release something broken then nerf it into the ground once they have their money.

playing from 9 years. it's a good game for beginners but too bad for F2P and starts getting much worst in higher arenas. Most of the cards are not even balanced properly even a 1 elixir card can kill 9 elixir card if you have spent some money on it. Clash Royale community is also fed-up of the officials of the game being too greedy and adding dumb things while removing all the good to make progress in game. after new latest update the progress of F2P have been cut of but 50%.,1,2025-12-02 11:17:58

repetitive and boring unless you want to pay for everything and then still boring lol try for yourself fun at first but too repetitive and so much stuff you have to pay for just to play and use,1,2025-12-04 07:24:46

The new update broke the game. If you're a new player you will not be able to compete unless you spend 100$. Pay-to-win broke the balance of the game. ☠️,1,2025-12-22 00:30:34
I was saving my epic cardboosts and they removed them all together without me ever using them ... and my knight elite wild cards became useless to ... I ve had around 35000 to 40 000 on him and they lessened the requirement to 4 000 thanks to which my previous grind for them became pointless... they do whatever they want with the game without caring for consequences and that's a huge red flag.,1,2025-11-30 00:48:21

"deserves one star for the devs extremely annoying practice which they refuse to change: introduce incredibly overpowered and stupid cards or mechanics that RUIN the game for MONTHS so that overspenders give them money to get what's new and strong, and only then nerf them. it has become so obvious and blatant it's just annoying, terrible and disrespectful. and progression nerfs seem to never stop.",1,2025-12-07 00:28:35
Scummy update. It wasn't made clear that upgrading cards to level 15 (especially champions/legendaries) prior to the update was much better and the EWCs which I worked hard for turned into essentially nothing.,1,2025-11-28 17:41:42

"this game from every update is becoming worse and worse from being fun, strategic, balanced and overall f2p game to p2w, unbalanced, removing good features for no reason, ignoring community feedbacks and very greedy i recommend to never play it",1,2025-12-08 15:33:46
there are so many characters to use with different skills and so many arenas. it takes so much time to pass arenas yet there are things like the clash pass that make it worth the time,5,2025-12-15 04:12:45
horrible I hate it. After heroes the game has just become pay to win slop. I have been in arena 19 for weeks and every single person is so paid to win it's crazy. don't play this game.,1,2025-12-25 04:57:15
New update just dropped and it's already totally unbalanced with the new character levels and pay to win evos. This game isn't worth playing especially after early arenas. #paytowin #noskillrequired,1,2025-11-26 06:46:07

Can you fix the 2 vs 2 because so many players left in the middle of the game can you put a system that punished them if they keep doing it at least put them in timeout,3,2025-11-26 00:20:42
game is a money grab. the only way to progress is p2w and has gotten 10x worse with the new heros update. This game is going down a bad path and is going to be dead in a few years.,1,2025-12-22 03:25:10
Definition of pay to win. A month of mega draft for ladder is a terrible idea. Diamond pass is a cash grab. Edit: just when you think it can't get worse they release heroes which favour decks like hog2.6. Not worth the time.,1,2025-12-28 19:12:51
"Ok now this Game is so fun and bad, but if you win you get Dopamin spiked. After looking at the reviews about people crying about Pay to win. With no adds the game wont make money. They NEED to have a ingame currency to make profit!",5,2025-12-24 07:39:09

"I am veteran player , playing this game for whole 6 years but this update is so sick that I can't even get 200 trophies in 50 matches because of this hero update and try to make unique deck system because I fed up of this 2.6 and 3.6 elixir deck players",1,2025-12-06 04:48:20
The heroes update was the worst idea ever. Absolutely trash that makes the game even more pay to win. Almost impossible for free to play players.,2,2026-01-03 05:35:54

The only most greedy game from Supercell. Keeps adding unnecessary updates and things which can only benefit players who have tons of money to spend on this game. #DeadGame,1,2025-11-28 11:03:16

This game is so pay to win which makes it challenging for me to climb up in trophies and i can almost throw my phone across the room but overall the game is great 👍 also one time i got so mad i throw my phone on bed which made it crack a little bit it still is a great game.,5,2025-11-29 10:08:47

The new update sucks. Players who had 15000 trophies were put down to 10000 trophies next to players who had just reached 10000. It's just unfair. Worst update ever.,1,2025-12-05 23:30:54

Unbelievable. Matchmaking is really unbalanced. If your opponent's troop is just 1 level higher you are fried. It's really competitive and meta decks are used like logbait or 2.6 elixir hog cycle. Evo mega knight and Pekka is the most ridiculous thing ever. Extremely pay to win. You used to buy chests with gems. They got rid of it. 2v2 battle is gone. Heroes are just on another level of stupidity and ridiculous. If you want to progress fast you are gonna have to say goodbye to your wallet.,1,2026-01-17 01:48:09

I think it is so good because I am pretty good at it. But there is one down part about it is harder to get to other arenas and to pick the characters you want,5,2025-12-06 11:33:12
if I could give 10 stars I would it's a fun strategy game and you can play with friends makes this perfect but the only bad thing is when the play goes into a losing slump not because of the game because of the player,5,2025-12-04 21:30:29

game is ruined with each update just trying to milk more money out of the community instead of trying to earn it in a healthy sustainable way they just bloat the game with different new (often gamebreaking) mechanics which are not even pay to win but pay to play,1,2025-11-25 06:42:28

it's just a pay to win game. no sense of competitiveness is left. pay and level up and win. I've decided to move on from this game.,1,2025-12-07 07:05:16

This game 🎮 s so fun I love it so much and the best part their are no ads so you don't get interrupted by a stupid ad so you need to buy it you won't regret it get clash Royale now,5,2026-01-17 06:58:28
this game is so damn P2W and there are just so many cards that need a rework and buffs and nerfs and gone from the game I could go on and on about which cards need to be deleted 1. mega knight: I don't need to say anything 2. sparky: WAY to much damage the dark prince needs a buff boss bandit needs a nerf I recommend not to play this game if you wanna play prepare your bank account it's like to level up you need to spend money just to play I bet in a year you have to spend 300$ to play,1,2025-12-15 23:10:45

worst game ive ever played. developers arent even hiding the fact that they are money hungry. they keep adding things to make money but it just makes the game even more sad,1,2026-01-13 03:05:51

Lv 16 drop was highly unnecessary and just progression with no meaning baked. There's no point when SC just casually dropped a new level every 2Y then it becoming a contest for whales instead of casual players,1,2025-11-25 10:42:22
"it's really fun but 70 percent of the time it makes you want to throw your phone across your room sometimes it's really p2w depending on what arena you are in ,but otherwise it's a pretty fun game",5,2025-12-01 23:49:28
the game was literally very good but after recent update game is takin too much long for loging the game it is not my problem of network but its the update which is not opening and day by day it is lacking to play game,4,2025-11-30 19:33:51
improve the matchmaking systems it just matches you with higher level players with high cards which is just annoying card levels matter when they are two levels higher than you a gap of one level is okay but 2 is just a slap in your face,2,2025-12-20 22:12:27
It is a very fun game but I just updated clash Royale and it doesn't let me log in to my account overall it is a very fun game very very very fun game me and my friends and brother's love it.,4,2025-11-26 03:10:59

"The single most disgusting money hungry game dev team I've ever seen in my life. You don't listen to player feedback. You don't listen to YouTuber/streamer early feedback. you push out an embarrassing amount of P2W features and offers, you don't care about balance at all, especially when the card is higher tier so it's more expensive to lvl up like Boss Bandit for example..

terrible it's pay to win don't waste your time or energy on this game unless your gonna pay for stuff to keep up with everyone it's sad how they made it like that and if you don't pay your gonna lose a lot till you actually get past good arenas not worth the time in my opinion so don't waste yours,1,2025-12-01 11:55:37

Update January 2026 Do NOT BOTHER. I've been playing this game since 2016 - that's 10 years. This new update SUCKS. You have to pay to actually advance now. It is all skewed against you like every other pay to play game.,1,2026-01-08 16:59:11

i loved clash before it got popular and now it's honestly a husk of what it used to be you need evos to win in high arenas and the pay to win is ridiculous and in arena one before you even play against a real person you can get cards that are 18 arenas ahead of you not to mention that heros and the new 2 champions and two heros makes it so people who pay to win almost never lose 3/5 just not the same.,3,2025-12-29 01:42:42
It was a good game but they continue to make it so much worse with each update while reseting progress and making it more pay to win it would be 1 star but i used to love it so i cant,2,2025-12-01 17:33:30
Supercell keeps changing content to make the game harder for f2p players and easier for p2w players. Removing progression items like magic books and allowing p2w players to spend gems directly to upgrade their cards is a horrendous idea.,1,2025-12-16 01:05:48

Fun but a bit pay to win i would say myself and the gems are a bad currency item and should be fully subbed with gold for everything so that all users are able to be less ptw,4,2025-11-30 06:00:24
"the game is so pay to win nowadays it is insane. Just by not having one evo you are going to get stuck at your current trophies. with the addition of lvl 16 the amount of work needed to get to max lvl becomes nigh impossible. the new hero ""evolution"" makes that even worse. most of the champions are now just worse than their hero counterpart. only getting 2 evo shards in a box is asinine. I need to roll high to get the evo box, then I need to roll the evo Im trying to unlock, then do that 2 more",1,2026-01-02 03:27:55

if I could I'd put negative stars they keep putting card and making strong card even stronger and the only way to upgrade you card so you can at least have a shot to win is by paying if you don't put money be sure that out of 10 games you only can win 2,1,2025-12-11 04:13:54

terrible pay to win slop it has been pure suffering to see them add constant pay to win updates that change the Meta and nerf the new best cards after the seasons over to force people to spend money to stay competing. aswell as breaking their promise of keeping level 15 the max. the addition of hero's and level 16 has killed the game. it is broken and the only way to get it is pay to win. abandon this game and play battle cats or something,1,2025-11-28 07:01:36
this game is good atleast back in the day the game was fun and the first 2 mistakes they made were getting rid of season pass which was a way for f2p players survive and actually win against p2w players now the game is about evo credit card and its hard as a f2p player since the game is great i have 6k trophies and im decent at the game so i know how the game works now with the addition of heros mid game arenas are gonna be hell i reccomend anyone who wants to download CR you better have money,2,2025-12-08 02:31:13

"Clash Royale is a fast-paced strategy game that blends tower defense, collectible card battles, and real-time multiplayer action. Players build decks using cards representing troops, spells, and buildings, then face off against opponents in three-minute duels where quick decision-making is key. Its mix of strategy and skill makes it highly competitive yet easy to pick up. The game’s balance of free-to-play progression and in-app purchases can be frustrating at times, but still very fun.",5,2025-09-03 04:24:22

"overall with the guranteed loss matchmaking and the unfairness of many pay to win , it makes progressing harder and not fun. the more you progress as a free to play you will find yourself at a king tower level disadvantage, troop disadvantage, and 60% of the time the game throws you in an opponent that has most counters to your deck. its all targetted for the players to not make much progress , overall not your best option to install and play",1,2025-11-29 23:56:52
the game has a pretty simple yet creative idiea and a good community! but its flaw is that it has a disgusting micro transaction(basically pay to win michanic) which ruins the balance between players in the game.,4,2026-01-20 19:23:27

extremely predatory business model. they wait until the game becomes mainstream relevant again and attract massive amounts of players before introducing gamechanging updating that force committed players to spend money or be swept,1,2025-12-19 11:52:24
"The game is no longer fun and it can never return to what it was years ago. The changes are very unfriendly to returning players who don't have access to evolutions, higher levels or even Ranked battles. The game currently has 2 modes (1v1 and Merge Tactics) which is a far cry from the Party button that offered ever-changing events. F2P still struggle in ladder and especially Clan wars.

"The game itself is good, but I feel like the developers only care about money now, rather than enjoyment, especially because of the ""kingly offerings"" event and buying evolution shards, while people that don't have the ability to, and actually want to enjoy the game get pretty much told pay or get out because of the matchups. (it's near impossible to progress being free to play.) I hope this game someday improves, because this is just disappointing",1,2025-09-14 19:36:24

"it took me years to reach 10000,, and all of a sudden when you be in the middle of a battle the connection automatically lost. making you login again only to see that you have lost. sometimes the game automatically freezes too. Very annoying when you're having network issues, and when you have a phone call just know that it's all over. Rubbish.... BUT ADDICTIVE 💯",1,2025-08-31 13:18:38
"Typical PAY-TO-WIN game, with a hilarious algorithm. Very often, in easy battles, the connection suddenly lags and delays. Only after the opponent gains the upper hand does it return to normal. The matchmaking algorithm is also too obvious. When we're forced to lose by the algorithm, it will select an opponent with a counter-strategic deck. Clash Royale isn't a game to prove skill; it's just a casual game for those who pay for the pass. For free players, keep dreaming of a fair and exciting game",2,2025-09-26 20:41:11
"This game is absolutely terrible. Match making system is broken. Nothing is more fun than being matched up against someone who is higher level than you and who is using cards that you don't have. Everyone is using the same play style and there isn't any variety to the game. If you want to spend a ton of money on the game then it MIGHT be fun for a while, but why bother? Update: they just added evolution to increase the pay to win incentive. If you want to progress then you have to pay to win.",1,2025-10-09 11:27:38
"This game used to be my favourite years ago. It saddens me to see the changes for the worst being made. No chests like before, worst characters and no 2v2 mode. The constant sudden pop ups, sounds amd colors to make it more addicting, make the game more stressful. The game is being changed to appeal to the new generation and getting ruined.",1,2025-10-19 17:13:06
"Who woulda thought, the game is still astronomically flawed. Matchmaking is so bad, last time I played I went against a guy 5 tower levels higher than me, their cards also WAY higher, so I don't get it. Idk if 7k trophies means I'm awful, but it's obvious now they don't care about fairness. Latency is a frequent issue, on various wifi, services, it's not reliable. There's a frequent delay when it comes to placing cards, it's not even worth playing for the daily tasks. Shameful",1,2025-11-13 16:04:51
"The game has unfortunately shifted toward a pay-to-win model. It used to have a balanced ranked mode where everyone had access to level 11 cards, creating a fair competitive environment. Now that mode is gone, and it feels like the focus is more on monetization than gameplay. It's a disappointing direction for what used to be a great game.😕😪",1,2025-08-24 08:52:02
This game is full of small and big bugs. Game bugs: Sometimes your net is great but the game has bugs and your internet is weak. The reason you lose is the game's fault. The game used to be very good but now your skill is not visible and the reason you win is because of the cards you choose. The game is full of robots that are extremely strong. Very expensive offers and... I can't say more.,1,2025-10-14 02:54:59
"Over the years, this game has devolved into a giant cash grab. I mean, whats even the point of calling it a strategy game when you can be in arena 1 and go against max level cards. I still play because when all is said and done its a fun game, but pay to win has just completly spiralled out of control, to the point where i wanna uninstall.",1,2025-08-23 14:16:32
"It is worst when it comes to rank system. I was playing against a player who has more level, more epic cards but he was on same rank as me. And the rank system placed him to play with me and 8 lost in a instance. Every time, the game lags even more and I suffer a severe loss. This eventually does not promote me to other arena Also, the game only gives me gold instead of cards and it lags so much that I have lost 5 to 6 games because of this loss. Please resolve these issues as soon as possible.",1,2025-10-08 10:03:02
"Somethings are very fishy here.. everytime right before I'm about to pass to next arena, all my opponents suddenly have that ""thing"" that I don't have, it could be evolutions, legendary heroes, or 15 level cards. And somehow those things that I can't beat is being sold at the shop for real money... hmmm... peculiar..",1,2025-10-19 16:16:07
"They've completely forgotten about trade tokens and magic coins; I can hardly even get a book without buying them. They've removed a lot of things that were used to level up and they didn't add anything in its place, the pass royale is more of the same, they removed many things by putting levels that you will hardly take advantage of",1,2025-09-02 09:09:33
took all the warmth out of it. total pay to win riddled with micro transactions. not worth it anymore. evolve cards are wild and create some cards that are kinda impossibly hard to beat. unless you have 20-50$ to consistently put into the game there's really no point in trying to get alot of trophies. no leveling system and you oddly don't get many cards that are in your active deck. it's fallen from a fun game to a pay to enjoy and win game so quick,1,2025-11-10 16:15:43
"Clash Royale may be one of the most popular mobile games in the world, but anyone who has actually played it knows the frustration runs deep. After losing yet another game, I can confidently say this app has more problems than positives, and here are several reasons why Clash Royale simply sucks. 1. Pay-to-Win Mechanics The biggest issue with Clash Royale is that it rewards players who spend money rather than players who actually have skill. Someone with a maxed-out Mega Knight doesn’t even nee",1,2025-09-29 07:03:55
I've played this game for about 5 months now and I love it. Compared to other phone games you can actually lose games and learn strategies to build better decks and combos. The only negative thing I have to say about it is it's definitely a pay-to-win game. Players in Arena 10 are spawning champions and spamming op cards that can't be unlocked until 6 arenas later,4,2025-11-04 04:22:35
"After over a year break, I reinstalled this game after seeing the ad for old players. Sadly, the same issue still exists: CONSTANT DISCONNECTIONS! Even with full 4G signal or stable Wi-Fi, the game suddenly disconnects in the middle of a match, while other apps and games run perfectly fine. This has been a problem for years and was the main reason I uninstalled before. The server feels unstable and unreliable, making the whole experience really disappointing!",2,2025-10-01 21:25:01
"This is a game with fun and original mechanics. The reason I rate it one star is due to its macabre amount of psychological manipulation. The game is made to be unfair; every once in a while, matchmaking places you against people with higher levels. You can still win these matches, but it's obviously harder because you unfairly start from a disadvantage. They do this so that you end up losing, get mad, and pay por the expensive upgrades that the game offers via its Battle Pass and shop ""offers"".",1,2025-10-28 02:26:05
This game is rigged. Been trying to get to max trophies for years now. Every time I'm one win away I get matched against someone who perfectly counters my deck. Begin the loss streak. Once this happens I won't get another win until I fall almost all the way down to the bottom of the arena I'm in. Another thing is that the opponents elixir usage doesn't add up when this happens. Over and over I've counted their elixir and mine at the same time. Not equal...and yes I know how to use it efficiently,1,2025-09-23 06:34:21
Too much gap when it comes to playing against people that buy cards. I understand you need to make money but this is just to much seeing lvl 15 card on a tower 12 player. And from what I noticed its 2/3 of players that are in my lobby. Maybe you sould think about filtering out regular and premium members so it can be a fair match. From what I see right now it's just not a strategy game anymore its just a pay to win game unless you are in higher arenas where you have to an extent maxed out card .,1,2025-10-22 15:52:12
"The bots have infinite elixir. If you don't like to be cheated out of wins, don't play this game. For example, I was in a match and had just played a push when the bot played a goblin hut, fireball, wizard, giant, and a knight for one side, and on the other played a mini pekka and tombstone, and this was not the only time it had happened either.",1,2025-09-28 20:35:48
"its either you win 5 times in a row to finally make it ti the next arena, get 1 win and 1 loss constantly, or lose 5 times in a row. the game is suppost to be ""strategic"" but you cant find a perfect strategy without spending like 20$ in-game because the game REFUSES to give you the cards you need to update your strategy to counter the constant other strategies that perfectly counter your strategy and then your opponents for whatever reason have cards from 3 arenas ahead of the one you are in.",1,2025-09-12 04:44:24
"The game is getting more and more pay to win. They give some free resources once in a while, but that's not enough. It is even worse if you are a new player or a returning player. You'll feel left out because you just don't have any evolved cards you want, even if you already grinded for weeks. Matchmaking and servers are usually terrible as well. New cards are usually overpowered, making you spend your money to get it, and then they'd nerf it. Thumbs up for successfully destroying the game.",1,2025-10-04 04:23:16
I've been playing this game for over a few years now and it's a good game when you're not playing no skill over leveled opponents who you somehow get matched against every game......this game is so money based you cant get anywhere without spending money the first thing you see when you click on the shop is flashing deals in your face immediately and 30 bucks for early access to new cards..... 30 bucks? This game is so pay to win I don't recommend even giving a thought to downloading this game,1,2025-09-02 10:12:25
"After 7 years of playing this game, today is the day I delete it for good! The P2P requirement is just ridiculous now and the evolution element has completely ruined the game. Out of every 10 games I reckon I play the exact same deck at least 5-6 times. The fun has completely gone and the players with money buy their way to the top! Such a shame as I've loved this game for so many years, but unfortunately like every other aspect of life, greed takes over and money always come first.",1,2025-08-31 07:03:47
"No matter what if you get one or more wins in a play session you will begin to be matched with people with counters and even just overall higher level cards, me with all level 8 and 9 cards sadly can't wipe someone with a level on me in towers and 2 or 3 additional levels in cards. Simply unfun after two or three games. adding this way later,after giving the game another try, game is unplayable after going back after some time. evolutions are required, or you're always gonna be a step behind.",2,2025-08-27 11:37:02
"This game has almost lost its fun and balance element, and while playing, I encountered several frustrated players. And for ""Merge Tactics"" it should be replaced with ""Merge Luck"" because it's not based on tactics but luck, after reaching 2500 and 2800, there will be a clear imbalance in the random distribution of cards. Playing 3x &3 winning the first order from 2800 to 2889 then the next 3 rounds will most likely drop back to the 2800-2820 area, this wastes 15 to 24 minutes of time. Not fun!!!",1,2025-08-26 14:17:41
"This game has turned into such a money grab. It used to be good when levels were capped at way lower numbers, but now people can just spend money instantly win. The way the arena's are, it's impossible to change your deck because without spending money you're just going to lose. I wish SuperCell would make it even possible to win by skill and not money. I also don't understand what their plan was with merge tactics, and it just seems like another way to spend money on this game",1,2025-10-25 15:47:03
"This game has so much potential. Clash Royale could definitely be a very good and competitive game the issue is supercell has basically destroyed any credibility the game had with the micro transactions. This game is pay to win which doesn't effect the best players it only effects the worst players and the average players. Unless you're willing to spend a few hundred dollars, Avoid the game. And if you feel like spending money on the game spend it on cosmetics so you don't make this game worse.",1,2025-11-09 05:04:46
"Only Supercell can manage to make a game this simple, a buggy mess. The game constantly crashes and disconnects. The disconnecting issue is especially engaging. It disconnects even when I have a perfectly stable network, and it loves to do so exactly during crucial moments in the match when you're dropping troops to defend a rush.",1,2025-10-02 21:47:16
"As a high arena player placed top 50 in the world, iv'e been playing clash since the week it came out, and I have seen how much the game has gone ,up down , and viral, and CRL is truely my favourite game by far, hence the fact that the new updates are terrific, the only bad thing is getting rid of the shop a couple months ago which I think is a disadvantage for lower arena players, becuase of the lack of items to get, anyway very good game highly recomend this, :)",5,2025-09-24 14:04:28
white outline around the cards like they got copied and pasted. Merge tactics just start inverting colors and makes it unplayable which was sad because that would be the only playable thing in this game on google play games because the lag and loading time to get to a normal match is enough for the opponent to kill you. Generally surprised but still needs a lot of fixing.,3,2025-10-07 09:15:44
"There was a clan challenge today that I stayed up until 2am to complete- took each member like 2 hours a piece, and the prize was only 8 tower princess cards. Rewards have gotta be bigger if we're gonna spend THAT much time on something. I know the game is pay to win for the most part, but this is a new low even for clash. Usually you're able to work hard to catch up with the paid players, but this is ridiculous. It showed a fancy silver chest and barely had anything in it.",3,2025-09-29 14:12:16
"Clash Royale was my favorite strategic game, easy to understand and fun, unfortunately if you want to level up you need to pay which makes it a pay to win game. it's incredibly hard to reach higher trophies because your opponents have double evolutions, higher king tower, higher card levels and sometimes the new evolution that you need to buy from the store. I'm at 13,500 trophies, level 14, only one Evo and 3 cards level 15. Solution? Making things more accessible (gold, evos, elite cards...)",1,2025-10-19 21:36:47

Now when i try to do anything my opponent brings out E-Golems, Mega knights and stuff you'll unlock extremely late in the game just in their deck cause they spent money.

After all the time and money I've spent. disrespectful!!!!!",1,2025-08-24 00:29:55
terrible game which is really sad because it used to be amazing. this game used to actually take skill but is now just a cash grab. if you don't spend money on the season pass you can't play the brand new broken evos for months. being free to play is extremely hard to get a full deck to level 15 so I'm stuck with level 14 cards which leads to really horrible interactions for me. level 15 and evos were the worst things ever added to this game which is such a shame. i can no longer be competitive,1,2025-10-30 12:31:57
"Amazing game for the first 7000 trophies. Once you get to there it turns into an endless grind of rage and pain and suffering until you finally reach 10,000. Then more pain and loss of brain cells to get to fifteen k. Once your there you get suckied into a infinite swirl of never ending grinding to keep you rank up every season.

"Made an accidental purchase because of how easy it is to buy and my phone was left on in my pocket. Then wanted to get a refund even though I didn't use what I accidentally bought of course because I don't want it and the process to get a refund is basically impossible, at least on android. Because no matter how many emails I send, they are either ignored or I get a reply saying that we cannot proceed with a refund because they don't have the tools for it apparently.

"Fun game, but 100% pay to win. It be really nice if they had a free to play version with ads is fine and then a pay to win version and split them. I quit playing a long time but came back to try it and it's the same. You'll just got a rank where people have way higher cards, special. cards, etc that they bought and unless you want to spend money or grind your 9 years, you are just stuck. There is definately skill to the game and you can't outplay people, but at some point you can't outplay.",2,2025-10-12 22:28:47
"9 year veteran with this game and I've never seen such a huge flip flop from a balanced game turn to pay to win. Its borderline cynical the way the game manipulates you. The grind to level 15 takes a level of dedication you'd put into a full time job. Or spend $1000 just to be at an even playing field. They introduce new evo cards that break the game every few weeks and bundles in the shop more than they balance the game by an exponential amount. Save your dignity, time, and money, just dont.",1,2025-10-23 03:31:19
"Absolutely terrible matchmaking and game play. Constantly matched with players leveled above or below you, you either win by a landslide or get destroyed. It's hard to upgrade or advance without spending money. No matter how much you upgrade you'll instantly be capped out by being matched against players above you again. Used to be so fun and insanely addictive, but they somehow totally ruined it, sad!",1,2025-10-05 18:05:45
"Since the November 2025 update I am unable to play the game. The game constantly crashes when I try to join a battle and suddenly closes, but the battle starts in the background cuz I am losing points. I cleared the data and also cleared the cache, then restarted the device and then tried to play the game again, still not working, still crashing when I try to start any battle. Also tried to delete the game and reinstall it, still crashing. Please fix the game!",1,2025-11-03 22:51:04
"Honestly, I used to enjoy Clash Royale, but over time, it just started to suck for me. The biggest problem is how pay-to-win the game feels. If you’re not spending money, you're basically stuck grinding for weeks just to level up a single card, while someone who drops some cash can max theirs out instantly. It’s incredibly frustrating to go into matches knowing you played better, but still lost because your opponent’s cards are two levels higher. Yall fvk with apples tho?",1,2025-10-12 11:40:20

"Bad and slow servers with frequent in-game lag. The developers should collect and analyze network-related issues for each device.

"A game once hailed as the pinnacle of 1v1 strategy games, with other gamemodes that introduced more fun ways to enjoy the game, now reduced to something equivalent to having been created by EA. There is now absolutely minimal strategy required; all that's needed is your wallet and credit card and you can enjoy trampling on players. Additional gamemodes have been overhauled, especially draft mode, creating snowballing and steamrolling situations. The P2W pass is not worth it. Go play COC instead.",1,2025-10-20 10:36:19
"This is the most stale, repetitive, frustrating steaming pile of rookie you can install on your phone. At the start it's fun but once people get the meta cards it becomes a bashing your head against the wall simulator, where you will play the same deck against the same decks and win or lose in the same way until you inevitably uninstall. Stay away, if you want a strategy game play Mindustry",1,2025-11-06 16:39:33

I play one of those 3 cards in every battle. If those cards are so good that they get played in literally every match, then maybe they're too good? I main the X bow, so killing them is not a problem. It just takes all of the fun out of the game when every match feels almost like a repeat of the match before.",1,2025-09-15 17:15:29
downloaded it again as I felt nostalgia. played a few games and then started running into players with tower buffs that make them shoot faster and character buffs that make normal characters evolved or whatever that aren't in the base game for players who don't pay 12$ a month for the pass. ridiculous. pay2win has no place in a strategy game,1,2025-09-15 10:30:22
"half the games you will lose because of p2w players, but the other half is are skill bases loses because of unfavorable matchups. But when you win and sometimes you lose, you have great games where both sides are equal without hardcounters. and the many modes and monthly updates.Keep the game fresh and interesting. It's really just a problem of overturning. And unfavorable matchups, and make the game worse, not that it could really be fixed fully.",4,2025-09-28 22:32:04
"It's a good game indeed. The problem I have and hate so much is how you get matched with decks that load way faster. They mismatch in a way that makes you lose. Also, support does not care about us. I was browsing reviews and noticed they don't try to respond. They love how we spend money(which I stopped)but do not address our concerns as gamers.",3,2025-08-31 23:34:12
"I really try to like this game each time i play it, but it's really hard with the problems it has. First of all, the servers are really bad. If you dont have max network connection, it lags, doesnt place the card you use, and even disconnects you. Secondly, it's always been a pay to win game, and Supercell endorses it eith the updates. Honestly, they had a full season with evos to buff the 2.6 hog cycle. Last of all, the matchmaking is doodoo. You either go against god tier players or bots.",1,2025-10-17 19:09:10

"I came back to this game after 3 years its still as horrible as when I left you cant progress at all unless if you pay to win the game literally. the game is based on levels of cards, the higher the level the more powerful, and you can buy your way to higher levels. this is fine but the game matchmaker you in mid ladder, mid game, against people who have spent 200 dollars on the game, and its every game, ive been stuck in the same spot for 3 weeks in arena 19.

"Terrible!! Super Cell has screwed this game up so badly with the matchmaking algorithms, evolutions, and the changing of the goblin hut and furnace cards.

Whoever is running the show at Super Cell needs to be fired for ruining what USED to be an awesome game.",1,2025-08-22 20:00:48
"As the updates continue, the gameplay becomes more and more dependent on how much money you need to spend in order to have fun.

"If you enjoy the game then play it, but the truth is only a very small percentage of people do. Most just play it because of some sunk cost fallacy. If youre thinking about playing it dont, you probably wont enjoy it after a certain point because its designed to be as frustrating as possible. All of this is done intentionally to push you into making purchases and toxicity is encouraged by devs. Matchmaking is designed to keep you at 50% winrate its statistically impossible to have these matchups",1,2025-11-18 11:57:41
If you are looking for a challenging game with more than 100 cards you have come to the right place. Now one thing I would like to say is that when I call this game challenging were talking I won't leave this game until I get to the next arena type challenging but in a fun way to. Each and every card is different from the last but some cards pair good with each other like when you get hog rider you can put the hog behind the mini Pekka to help him get to the tower faster. This an amazing game,5,2025-10-02 07:15:02
"I’ve been playing Clash Royale for years, and it honestly hurts to write this, but the game has become almost unplayable. For the last few weeks, the app keeps crashing nonstop. Every time I go into a match, the screen freezes or the whole game closes by itself. I lose trophies, lose progress, and waste time trying to reopen it again and again. It’s extremely frustrating. My device can easily run much heavier games with no issues, so this is clearly a problem with the game itself, not my phone.",1,2025-11-14 20:44:26

This game is the definition of pay-to-win. I haven't made a single micro transaction at all in the game. It's nearly impossible to make any progress unless you feed the corporate greed. Other than my pay-to-win opponent spamming goblin boohoo every other match, it's fun.",1,2025-10-06 00:34:08
This game is pay to win don't get it. It will put you against players with higher level cards. The tournaments are rigged for pay to play players. I've played since it first came out and it's honestly sad how bad the games gotten since the beginning. Plus you only play against people that base their deck off of tower cards. Like what's the point of playing a game if you're only going to go against a YouTube deck or someone hiding behind their tower cards. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!,1,2025-09-09 09:52:53
"Im sorry, if I recalled a game is supposed to let you have fun right? Yet, Ive play this game for 2 years and the P2W situation has never changed.

"A Fantastic Strategy Game! Review: ★★★★★ Clash Royale is an absolutely addictive game that combines strategy, skill, and a bit of luck! I love the variety of cards and the way they can be combined to create unique strategies. Each battle feels fresh and challenging, with endless opportunities for tactical play.

The matchmaking system is fair, ensuring I compete against players of similar skill",5,2025-10-10 07:21:15
"this game seemed fun at first, but don't let it fool you. I had fun playing up till around 6k trophies. every game I played no matter what deck I used I would instantly get hit with a hard counter. I was about to make it up another arena and I was one game away so I felt kind of good. fast forward to now, I'm writing this review after cutting myself because I lost 36 games in a row. I used so many different decks and counters but I always lost. this game caused me to relapse into self harm.",1,2025-11-15 10:18:10
"I used to enjoy this game but I no longer do, the game is way to pay to win now. I got to Arena 15 and started losing a lot of games due to other player's troops being higher level than mine.

"DO NOT INSTALL THIS GAME UNLESS YOU HAVE ACESS TO A CREDIT CARD WITH ALOT OF MONEY. Sure the games fun at first. Strategizing which characters you're going to pick for your deck, but once you have reached a certain amount of trophies, pay to win becomes serious. Card upgrades and evolutions are behind a paywall. If youre free to play, goodluck getting cards for units you actually need for your deck.

I understand that they want to keep the game new and exciting, but every damn week or 2, they COMPLETELY change the ""stats"" of the cards. Its so bad now, that i COMPLETELY REFUSE to spend ANY MONEY on this game, whatsoever. On one day, you could invest all your coins & resources into beefing up a card, and the next day, THEY COMPLETELY CHANGE HOW the card even works! Very sad.",1,2025-11-03 16:20:31
"pay to win, poorly balanced matchmaking which i assume is a product of the pay2win algorithm. I feel these devs need to go back to square one, and find out why people enjoyed this game in the first instance. As of now it feels fixed and soulless.

Please fix this !!!!!!!!!!!! I do not want to start again,1,2025-10-16 13:13:01
I used to absolutely love this game I would play every day after school and have a blast. nowadays the game is plagued with people in mid ladder who spend hundreds of dollars to have everything maxed out and I physically can't compete. I wish this game was more focused around the common player rather than the ones who make the game the most money. the matchmaking isn't all that good either I only have 3 level 15s and have a my decks are under leveled but end up fighting players with maxed decks.,1,2025-09-18 19:42:09

Even deleted progress to try and replace it..

After maintenance the game being played with a strong network connection actually freezes on multiple occasions and lost of trophies overall game is actually good but I would love to give it a 5 star but actually with a few bugs like playing the game with a strong network connection is just freezes that's not on wonder who will take accountability for the loses of trophies when players work hard to get up to reach their goals and how will you'll resolve the issue!!!!!,2,2025-10-27 00:12:43
"One of the worst matchmaking systems in online game i ever experienced. If you play well the game will make you face exactly 2-3 levels higher cards opponents, which on higher arenas becomes absolutely unplayable. The only way to upgrade is to donate or play some garbage modes to earn more cards, which you will have to do a lot, since upgrading champions or legendary cards without actually buying them can take months or even years.",1,2025-09-26 22:15:48
"Used to have a good review but supercell, the players and general gameplay have gotten absolutely horrendous.

"Too many absolutely annoying cards that allow low skilled players to completely abuse them and win in a vast amount of cheap ways. Also, the matchmaking is unambiguously rigged to keep the win/lose ratio close to 50% - you could be winning many matches in the row, and then you take a distinct u-turn and go on a losing streak. As time passes, these conditions get gradually worse, since they keep adding abominable cards, mechanics, and other annoying changes. The worst of all - it's Pay-To-Win.",1,2025-09-30 11:32:27

Everything about it is just the worst, I mean the game is completely unfair, I mean you play against players that have stuff you unlock many arenas a head and another thing is that when you are about to reach like 3000 trophies the game puts you in a match with a much more skilled player than you and then you lose like 5 times in a row, which is what happened to me and i was only at like 2000 trophies and took ages trying to get to the next arena.",1,2025-10-02 22:08:05
The game is hardly worth playing. It takes unbelievably long to level up. the only way to get cards is to get on everyday and win up to 4 games for loot boxes that give barely anything. So it requires at least 20 minutes everyday for months to get cards leveled up so that you can climb ladder. It's not fun.,1,2025-10-07 01:18:41
"Like all mobile games, it seems fun for a while, then it becomes increasingly difficult to progress unless you pay. They all have a gambling feel to it, i.e. you win some, you lose more. Clash Royale is exactly the same. Great way to get people addicted and waste all their time and money. I have uninstalled this game.",1,2025-08-29 21:22:17
"Honestly speaking, it's a great game, BUT it's pay to win like crazy. It's also super annoying that when I don't buy the battle pass, I will go against every counter to any single deck I use, it also takes slightly longer to find a match, like they are hand picking my opponent. YET the minute I buy the stupid pass, I fly up the ranks like nothing, I somehow all of a sudden don't get a single counter deck until I get to the higher ranks again. It's just hilarious to me.",2,2025-10-31 22:16:47
this game is so bad there is so much p2w and it doesn't care about your level you could be level 12 and it would give you a level 15 enemy which is 100% lose and the game play is so bad. The cards in the game are so unbalanced as some cards are rlly good and some are bad. the flash royal person sometimes maybe watches you and they will purposely give you enemies that have hard counter or are just p2w most of the game is bad and I do not recommend this game to anyone as the Devs are money hungry.,1,2025-08-24 09:12:28
"5 words. THIS IS WHY WE CLASH! No but seriously, this is a highly addicting game and can get frustrating sometimes but thats every game. Yeah this game has pay to win aspects but doesnt every game? It is still fun to play even if you are free to play, since after getting the cards you want which there are over 100 you can just hop into 1v1 mode where pay to win doesnt matter as much(except evos). I do highly recommend since this game is updated monthly with new content and a ton of challenges.",5,2025-11-13 10:04:31
It used to be fun and the items in the game used to be cheap. why does the item increase in value? this makes the game unplayable because of all the p2w player causing this no skill level and evos. im just hoping that your team acknowledge this issue with your game and make it budget to other currency's because that would really be helpful.,1,2025-09-21 14:50:19
"First, this game is one of the best games I have ever played, would recommend completely. Alright, the only issue I see is the loading in the game it usually stops at 75% and does not go up higher, but a lot of the time I am in the middle of a match and I have a big advantage over my enemy and the game crashes when I have really fast internet and makes me lose the match. A lot of people say this game is pay to win but it really isnt, but sometimes you vrs p2w players but the system isnt perfect.",5,2025-11-02 03:10:10
"Clash royale is a great game that involves strategy and lots of fun.However there are some frustrating things about it, it is really easy to come across a p2w player because they are usually extremely over levelled and can win without any skill whatsoever.Despite this once you get to the much higher arenas most people will already have high level cards and the game will gradually become much much harder. In conclusion it is a very fun and enjoyable game although it does have some weaknesses.",4,2025-10-28 02:02:29
Game just keeps getting worse with the 6 month update taking the good free items and making them less and less worth going for. It is most definitely a pay to win game on top of them constantly putting you against players that have all of your decks shut down cards.

"I genuinely cannot fathom how pay to win this game is. One sided game. Words cannot describe how much money you have to put in to win games. One out of five stars is too much as a review. Doesn't even deserve 0. Graphics and mechanics are alright, but it's just p2w. Last clan voyage we got 3000 trophies just for princess cards, and I get literally about 1000 gold from a 4 star chest.

"This is a game I've had since it release. Hit max ladder and everything. Everytime I get on it has become more and more of a soulless money grab. Cards are more broken than ever and the ease at which you can pay to be better than other players is ridiculous. To even have a competitive experience you have to have a full level 15 deck.

Changing my rating from. 5 to 1. Merge Tactics is bs. The opponent starts with 3 troops and I start with 2 all the time. The deck of troops you give me is always useless and I can make a decent merge. It was good when I started playing it and now it's completely useless.

"Super fun gameplay. I have played on and off for about 10 years now. It's so sad to see this game devolve into what it has. The pay to win model is overwhelming. On the homescreen there are no less than 5 large buttons asking you to spend real money on stuff. I was so excited to see that they give out the premium currency now, except you cannot use it on anything anymore. Can't buy chests, you can just get emojis/wild cards. The hero/evo feature is awesome...except you have to pay 10-20 PER HERO",1,2026-01-26 05:32:02
"It's great game altogether, and I would rate 5 stars, but some cards that were early on but then moved to higher arenas are still accessible to the people who had them, so they had an advantage, which isn't really fair. But for gameplay, it's mostly skill, which makes it a good game. <--- (2022) Now, in 2025, the best way to progress is to just use evo credit card and buy your way to the top. No skill, just spend money. More money means easier gameplay.",3,2025-11-24 10:56:59

"A GAME OF WALES AND 13 YEAR OLDS. The game is fun if the match is balanced, but that only happens on special occasions. otherwise, you will face off against someone who has spent way too much money for the newest release of cards because they are always broken to be OP. As a long-time player, this really hurts the desire to play. Match making is also broken. If the AI wants you to lose, it will subtly make your elixir spawn in slower than your opponent.

This game has a network problem and wifi also doesn't work well this game definitely needs some good update instead of just sucking money of players..,1,2025-12-31 00:55:24

very good game! it's fun enjoyable but very ptw. I feel like there should be some way for free to play players to play by themselves.👍,3,2025-12-12 08:03:57
well it's fun to play but there is too much pay to win and sometimes froze my game or restart my game but it's still fun.,3,2026-01-03 22:37:52
I cant hardly play rhe game because im in arena 10 and playing with people level 11 evo mega night and stuff and it's not fair if a ptw (pay to win) player is going against a person that hasn't spent not 1 cent on the game.,1,2025-12-11 05:54:13
Well I was hooked when the evo witch was released. leveled 5 cards to 15 and well after all that level 16 now and new Heros. They have became greedy paybto PLAY.,1,2026-02-01 06:08:25

Great game to begin with then gets p2w and boring. Stupid updates and need to buy stuff to make it playable ruins it. Once you get past arena 8 or 10 it gets super repetitive and unfair with the match making that I just got super fed up. So hard to get 15k trophy's and actually play the game without paying.,1,2025-11-26 15:15:58
"I can't with this game anymore... I started playing so far back and I loved this game! But nowadays it's nothing but pay-to-win and micro transactions, it's horrible.

"""Dark Elixer"" troops are just the most annoying and obvious pay to win additions to the game. Having it is basically a free win if your opponent doesn't. I'm not some new player who doesn't have them yet either, I've played for 7 years and STILL don't have them despite grinding the game. An addition that basically requires paying for it and is super overpowered to the point of making the matches one sided in horrible and goes to show just how greedy Supercell has gotten.",1,2025-11-11 08:17:29

Even after many years the devs have still not fixed the matchmaking in Clan Wars. It really is not fun going against players who have cards that are 5 levels above me. Complete Pay to win gameplay. I cannot understand why the card and tower levels cannot be capped at lvl 11 to make the gameplay more fair. Making the matchmaking based on win rate is a sure fire way to make it unfair for low level players,1,2025-10-30 17:36:51
The game is very unplayable now. The game was so strategy based back in the day and now it's like every time I play it I'm forced to spend at least $10 to enjoy this game. Also AI shouldn't get infinite elixir. Every game I queue into an AI cycles a giant and wizard every goblin card in the game. I mean are you guys even restricting these robots to 8 card decks? Also the game isn't even fair anymore. Prince in a starters arena? Evolution firecracker to. You've definitely lost 1 player for good.,1,2025-10-21 09:42:07

"This game is so abysmally pay to win, the concept of balance is a foreign one in this games context. The matchmaking is designed to reel you in with easier match ups and then after a few games it hits you with a series of high skill players that are out of your league and most of the time over leveled. This then pushes you to spend money to win or else you'll have a miserable time. Do not recommend unless you want to either dedicate your entire life to this mess of a game or spend a ton of money",1,2025-11-09 19:50:58
"Great game, but im putting two stars due to the fact that the skill based matchmaking is honestly horrible and someone with their highest level card being 12 can face someone with level 14 decks.

But, instead, we got this game where they overloaded us with boring, super overpowered troops, or useless troops.

Don't bother playing this game if you don't want to spend. it is so pay to win at this point. Wasn't bad a while ago but now it's unplayable. Can't even play the game really without paying cause every game you go into has someone who just dropped $100 on it for the new evolution. or for 5000 epic cards to upgrade everything and then don't even bother trying after champions are involved someone drops $8 to $9 dollars per champion card and then boom nothing you can do. the game was fun but not now,1,2025-09-22 03:25:10
"As a fan of supercell I thought I would give this a go. Enjoyed it a lot at first, fun units and strategies, but later the matchmaking goes of a cliff. Matching against players with troops/cards 3-4 levels higher? What's the point, just give them a free win and don't waste anyone's time? The odd one like this would be forgiven, but it's not and I like my time. Uninstalled. Events are ok, but some better guidance as to what items are would be good (i buttons like in CoC).",1,2026-01-18 10:03:28
Terrible. Way too many pay-to-win players. The game never rewards players who do not pay-to-win. The free pass used to be good but the rewards you get are now worthless. Don't play it. If you finish the free pass all you get are 1 star rewards for hours of playing. The matchmaking is also terrible. This game used to be good. Hopefully supercell will actually listen to its game's players,1,2025-09-28 20:31:18

Lvl 16 is broken. Supercell really messed up with this update for the free to play players. Very disappointed in the developers. Wasted my gold and time on lvl 15 and 14 only to be dropped back with 2 lvls and can't compete.,5,2025-11-28 20:46:49
"I installed the app because my 15 year old son plays it. I thought I'd play it for a bit with him over the weekend, have a common interest to talk about. I am still playing the game 2 months later and, trust me, that's saying a lot for the game. I get bored easily. This game is a lot of fun. I buy the monthly pass because Supercell makes the purchase worth it. This month, the pass gave me all 6 shards to unlock the Evo Skeleton Army, and that's just one reward of 100+. Definitely recommend. 😜",5,2025-10-26 01:48:17
Game is pay to win and need to much of your time if you actually want to progress to higher arenas,3,2026-02-03 01:36:42
it's fun to play but don't pay for anything. I paid over 30 bucks for this special offer to get a legendary card early (I'm at arena 9 atm) but it only gave me an epic card which I already had. I don't mind paying for cards or chests if I get what they advertised. it was really annoying when I spent all that to get nothing pretty much. game play is really good tho. def recommend to anyone to play. Just don't fall for those special offers they give u. not worth it - won't buy anything more!,3,2025-09-26 06:09:08
"I've been playing for almost 10 years now, and this is one of the BIGGEST pay-2-play scams on the Google Play Store. Don't be fooled by its free to start nature. They only care about money. Supercell doesn't care about the average player. They only want to sell more overpowered cards in the shop, before changing them once enough, people have wasted money on it. shameful, I had high hopes for supercell, sad.",1,2025-11-17 21:19:03
the game fun it's the money it forces you to spend the removed the shop by the clan icon and don't give anything good on the normal pass it's so annoying which is why im probably gonna uninstall the game,1,2025-12-30 22:19:16
this game is the horrible anytime you try to get to the next arena you are paired with pay to win players for the next 20 games. overall a regular pay to win game,1,2025-12-30 20:33:26
"i really like the game, playing it in your free time is great, but I just got hacked out of my account and I lost all progress, I've tried contacting from Help and Support, but it just says ""we can't help with that"" it would be great if you could help me get it back because I really like the game!",1,2025-11-15 05:51:02
"with the most recent update of adding lvl 16 cards and towers its been a pain and a struggle to get a win, they even took out the rarity books so now f2p cant catch up with p2w as easily. From a lvl 14 tower with lvl 14-15 troops for my main deck",2,2025-11-25 09:45:01

Heros are the worst thing they have ever added to the game along with upgrading the card max level would give 0 stars if that was a option.,1,2025-12-11 08:03:01
"The worst matching system I have ever seen in my life is when I will come across a league, and those who have an anti-decker come across the decks they use are made with the same ticket.",1,2025-12-25 03:12:41
"Clash Royale is pure rage bait now. When I bought the pass, matchmaking felt easy and I kept winning. The moment I went free-to-play, the game started giving impossible matchups and over-leveled opponents. It clearly rewards paying players and punishes those who don’t spend. Feels totally unbalanced and manipulative. Not fun anymore and definitely not recommended.",1,2025-11-19 01:07:13
played ten game 8 of them had mega knight just tired it gets boring and repetitive and hate to see one card ruin the game for me besides that its hard to level and can definitely be pay to win in some aspects,2,2025-12-15 04:56:58
it's like having an amazing and well trained puppy grow into a mangey mutt over the course of 10 years. supersellout more like it,1,2026-01-30 17:07:21
"This is an awful game and the latest update was absolute garbage. I used to enjoy the game but with every new update, it's become clear that it's definitely p2w. The only reason, IMO, that this game is still a thing is because of the addictive, gambling-like, feel that keeps a certain player base paying money. Supercell seems to try to make Clash of Clans a player friendly game, but for some reason the devs of Clash Royale are determined to make their game un-fun for the majority of players.",1,2025-12-13 10:12:05
once I get far it's just a bunch of over powered mega knight players they never nerf that stupid car makes it horrible to play and even try to rank up once u do get 10000 trophies to play ranked it's terrible set up,2,2025-12-29 06:09:26
"this game was peak middle to late 2025 but now in 2026 and the introduction of heroes, clash is become more pay to win and boring but I would recommend playing it",4,2026-02-07 17:11:00
"3 days later after the new update came, the game has been crashing many times as well as login is failing too",2,2025-12-06 22:44:05

"Clash Royale is a very fun and addictive game. There are just a few things I have a problem with. this game is extremely p2w. I'll have games going up against level 15 cards while my average is still 11. I don't agree with some of the things supercell has done. like the shop being taken, chest getting removed, And some of these buffs and needs that they add are ridiculous. but other than those concerns the game is truly fun and you can meet some great people on the game through there clan system",3,2025-09-16 00:12:37
"your game is damn buggy every time I play there will be games where it thinks my WiFi or data is off , it just freezes and I have to off and on my WiFi /data just for a stupid notification to pop up asking me if I want to try connecting again by the time I get back into the game I lose 1 tower .. it's not a WiFi or data issue since I'm still using the same WiFi when I reconnect.. fix this pls",1,2025-11-06 22:08:20
Terrible how many cheaters and bots play this game and you can only report if they are in a clan. you should be able to report when they have endless elixir,1,2026-01-29 06:05:21
fix the clan wars make them like classic battles level 11 all around. base it off skill not card and tower level it's BS.,1,2026-01-30 12:40:37
A great strategy based game with cards that fight in battle for a chance to win two kings go in one comes out.,5,2026-01-30 06:02:09
like the pay to win to go down but overall it's a good game and fun to play with friends!,4,2026-01-29 19:27:40
I been playing Clash Royale for a year now i think that supercell should get rid of is level 16 update it making easier for pay to win player or if you don't do that the clash royale is broken right because supercell don't listen to the community,3,2026-01-29 01:36:30

"After the recent updates, the game can't go full screen. Have to exit game then reopen it. But it will happen again. Pretty bad 👎",1,2026-01-09 06:41:43
Been playing for 8 years now. Saw the new update trailer for level 16 and the hero cards and now I don't want to play anymore. The greed has overtaken clash and I've had enough of it. It's not worth your time or your money to play this game. I quit.,2,2025-11-22 21:06:18
"is a nice game. But after a point, the opponents are far superior. The cards the opponent uses are more advanced than the arena you are currently in. And the opponent seems to have infinite elixir towards the end of the game and they play numerous cards right after one another. Example where the opponent plays 4 cards in a row, including 2 witches. Each witch requires 5 elixir. You can only store a maximum of 10. 2 witches is then 10. Yet the opponent just played cards requiring at least 15.",1,2025-09-23 05:26:16
"Really addicting game, it can be pretty frustrating playing against pay to win players but for the most part if you're skilled enough you can climb the ranks rather quickly. Too many people complain about P2W when they just suck at the game, everyone can get to 10k trophies without paying a penny if they actually try for a bit so I wouldn't say it's enough to make me dislike the game. The mechanics are overall very nice and the balancing is decent imo (except for most newly released cards)",4,2025-10-30 03:51:15
"After leveling the card to maximum, I need to redo again. Each time they do the same again. This is really ridiculous",1,2025-12-01 20:19:59
"until recently it was ok, it has gotten worse and worse over the years but now they have reached a new low. Heros are a terrible mechanic worse than evos and are broken ive been hanging on but i just cant take it anymore. I dealt with evos, chamions, but heros i cant. You dont even get to choose witch heros you unlock unlike evos, it just sucks",1,2025-12-15 09:44:34
"Money grab pay to win game, before 2019 the game was balance, the pay to win wasn't an big issue, but right now is just a card game. Not worth the time to play and return after years. Even worse that i had a account linked to this one but supercell deleted it, and never told me that they did that.",2,2025-08-22 03:00:26
"fun for a little bit but let's get to the higher levels it leaves you in a lockdown, you can't level up everybody you fights is at a higher level than you it has characters you haven't even unlocked yet and that kills the game you'll beat a couple you'll move a little bit forward and the Quest level but then be given people that are more powerful not getting it back down three or four quest levels can you repeat this process over and over even if you play with the best character you have unlocke",1,2025-11-03 07:52:31

Latest changes (can't bring myself to call it an upgrade) have severely diminished the enjoyment of the game.,1,2025-12-07 17:55:05
"lag, crash, blurry graphics, does not work properly on PC, very bad performance, stucks and hangs",1,2025-12-30 02:13:41
It's fun to fight other players online. Lots of skills and thoughts used to play this game. That's why we clash.,5,2025-12-20 09:50:53
"this game was so fun like a year ago but it was sorta repetitive so I left it for a bit, I log back in and the game is so pay to win its not even funny. the new evolution mechanic is basically unavailable for people won't don't wanna waste money for a game like this and as such the overpowered characters lead to the people willing to spend 100s of dollars to this have such an advantage it's so unfair.",1,2025-10-22 07:25:41
The last update was the worst one yet. finally get to a point of playing on level playing field just to be reset. That was the last straw. I'm done playing this game.,1,2025-12-11 09:38:59
so fun you can pay to win and have fun or be free to play and have fun some people will be annoying with a bunch of stuff but if you beat them it makes it so much better,5,2025-12-13 21:34:30
"Don't download it, for at least the last 2-3 years the devs have beeen getting more and more greedy; one example is that they release broken stuff only to nerf it to the ground next month and scam a good chunk of the playerbase. Not to mention some of their practices should be, if not actually are, illegal. It was a good game till then, now it's just a scummy piece of filth.",1,2025-11-23 01:35:55
"The game is cool in all,no ads,online, competitive.But one thing I hate is when an opponent has higher level cards than me. I can't stand that,it's very annoying too. Supercell took away the chests,and I don't have most of the cards. So please,supercell please fix the game and card levels. There are times where my opponent is in a higher league than me,Also it's pay to win so no wonder it's harder for ones like myself.",3,2025-09-15 02:59:28
"matchmaking is horrible. players can just give supercell 50 bucks and they cant lose. if you win more than twice in a row next game you will get an unbeatable enemy and lose. and its always right when you need 1 more win to a milestone. brainrot games have better gameplay than this if i could delete any game i would choose this and its also somehow in ""top 1 in 0€ strategy"" while being impossible to play by being f2p.",1,2025-08-28 00:13:21

"Wonderful gameplay and fun to do. But the Amount of changes has me "" not wanting "" to play as much. Due to Health Changes to High Mana Creatures. Increase Health in low mana creatures. Plus, in clan war search. Sometimes I will face lower level opponents. Much care for the makers. now changed towards 3 stars. Again, low mana creatures shouldn't be able to defeat high mana creatures within less than 2 seconds now. Starting to get frustrating, having to edit my decks non-stop for these updates",2,2025-10-11 00:45:49
The game would be great if I didn't go into every new arena 3 levels below everyone and didn't have to spend 100$ just to get one card leveled up 3 times,1,2025-12-08 22:25:40
"Played this game back in '15 for a couple of years, then took a hiatus until about a couple of months ago. My only gripe is that you can easily get up to 500,000 coins, but you can't use them for anything. My other issue is the connection. I have full service whether on wifi or not, and I've lost countless matches because I can't play. Good game, fun game, but if I can't play because of connection issues, then I shouldn't lose trophies.",4,2025-09-03 03:48:53

"Game mechanics favor players who spend money. As you get higher in trophy count it is noticeable that players who spend money (maxed out cards, evolutions) get more points to quickly deploy cards. Even having a deck with low spending does not offset the games favoritism. Overall wouldn't recommend for any new players.",1,2025-09-23 20:38:09
"Supercell is the greediest company I have ever encountered, and I play gacha games! 2025 has been the worst year for the game by far. The developers take any opportunity to nickel-and-dime their loyal fans even when they are killing it in the profits department. This absolutely disgusting behaviour is then rewarded by consumers who hurry to buy the next pass or offer they see. It's truly a shame to see a creative game meet a fate like this.",1,2026-01-01 13:41:33
"Money Hungry, Dont really care what players want , just keeps pushing content the players (dont) want. if your new dont download you will never be max level without giving em a lot of money",1,2025-12-30 02:34:07
"It's a very fun and enjoyable game most of the time. However, they keep adding new mechanics and parts to the game that makes progressing take even longer. It also heavily favors pay 2 win, and that only gets worse with each update. They also removed a large section of the game (the events tab) so there's no longer a way to get trade tokens. They got rid of books too!!! That was the only viable way to upgrade past level 14. Now if you want upgrades you need to grind out for multiple hours a day",3,2025-12-20 12:45:25
I will be honest the game is fun when you are in lower arenas but after you hit 5k trophies thats where it ends. There's no fun in it anymore. The game gets so toxic I just want to play the game and not deal with some skill less push. The only thing in this game you need is the credit card because it is so heavily pay to win. This game sucks so don't play it. it is not worth the time and money you need to spend just to hit a certain arena.,1,2025-10-19 21:52:32
"Rampant pay-to-win issue. You can build a great deck, put in effort, and actually enjoy learning the game but none of it matters once you face opponents stacked with over-leveled legendary cards and evolutions way beyond your arena. Every match feels hopeless unless you open your wallet. New players get crushed almost instantly, and the game clearly pushes you toward spending money just to stay competitive. What could have been a fun, strategic experience has turned into a frustrating cash grab.",1,2025-11-05 10:54:33
"Clash Royale is the best mobile game out there. It's the perfect mix of strategy, quick thinking, and fun. Every battle feels unique because it's not just about strong cards but how you play them. I love experimenting with different decks, and the updates always keep things fresh. Climbing the ranks is thrilling, and even losses help me improve. Plus, being in a clan and working with friends makes the game even better. I can easily say Clash Royale is my favorite game ever.",5,2025-10-04 00:45:45

"The game became very pay-to-win now. They released another update where they effectively reduced all of your cards' levels by one, and then push ""deals"" to you to make you buy with real money, so you can get back to your old level. You basically have to spend like 20 bucks to buy their battle pass monthly to be on equal footing with other ppl. If you didn't buy it, you would just lose to someone that did buy it.

I began the game a week after release and it was fun with all the creative strategies and minimal cards with random decks, but throughout the years the game has added more cards and updates players like me think that began the downfall. Needless to say the game is absolutely horrible and the developers need to add back old game modes including 2v2's.",1,2025-10-31 11:57:47

"The game is too pay to play. I came back after stopping for a while and was having a fun time until I reached about 7000 trophies. When I got to this point a new update came out; bringing level 16. That's when the game took a turn, almost every game I would see the same level 15 or 16 card, mega knight. It made playing the game for free impossible. The game has just gone downhill after this update. Super Cell clearly cares more about making money than they do about the player base.",1,2025-12-25 05:24:56

"The game has become increasingly pay-to-win, especially after the introduction of Heroes.

"This game sucks. It lures you in until you spend a bunch of time on the game. Then the pay to win kicks in and makes the game unplayable. You can win by just mindlessly playing cards that are 2 levels higher than other cards. The bugs make the game even worse. You try to get into a match, and sometimes it's just staying on the loading screen while you're getting 3 crowned. Other times you load in and it says, ""please wait a moment"" while your opponent takes a tower and half of your king. Sucks",1,2025-12-15 17:31:16

Now it's nearly pay to play. edit: Tried the game again. It's even worse. Now there are champions that are incredibly overpowered. some of which are locked behind a pay wall.

Releasing new and broken features constantly (evos, heroes, etc). Horrible balancing of the game. In game purchases that are not worth half the price they charge. The list goes on and on.

"Fun and playability for the first few months: amazing. That moment when you work your way up to Legendary Arena and realize that this is just a game of rock-paper-scissors dressed up to look pretty: disappointing. Yes, there's some strategy, but that only happens in about 20% of the matches, when you happen to be well-matched with an opponent. Unfortunately, 4 out of 5 matches you're faced with an imbalanced match-up.",2,2025-09-15 07:54:20

For example I have 2 accounts and 60% run Mega Knight variations. None of the spells have a counter (Freeze countered by heat for example)! It's sad now!!",1,2025-08-24 08:43:22

"I feel like this game just went from a skill level base of gameplay to a pay to win gameplay. Im on arena 21 and from here I feel like it's obligatory to spend money to get to the next arena, I just go against non stop level 15 players while I only have 2 cards at level 14, and even if I tried to switch decks it's only worse since they are even lower level, I don't know if the problem is skill issue or it's just genuinely bc I need to spend on microtransactions.",1,2025-10-29 16:20:23
"Genuinely a piece of trash game, only good for merge tactics at this point. They say they base match making off of trophies yet I'll change one card and go against the lowest skill players in the game, switch that card back after the game? im against regular, not brain dead players, but guess what they're overleveled.

"Greedy pay to win game, when you reach a certain number of trophies, you start to face the same overleveled overpowered cards that are designed in a way to make people pay real money to over level, making the vast majority of gameplay repetitive, annoying and unfair to the f2p player.

"The gameplay is fun BUT who wins is decided at match start around 40% of the time if someone bought cards and evolutions you just simply lose, it's often about pay to win rather than skill or strategy, if they paid to have better tower level and unit level there isn't much you can strategize to win there just stronger, really frustrating to play against that, also with the new arena changes if you weren't playing before the changes the people at your trophy level have cards you can't get",2,2025-09-19 22:55:23
"game isn't fun to play. there are no guard rails to save you from playing against people with way stronger decks. you can't surrender to save yourself time or frustration. sometimes you only win 1 in 4 games. some people are so down bad to win, that even after you go afk, they will sit there, shaking in fear, floating elixir, scared that you will surprise combo them, so they will play very slowly and just run the time out, even though you already left and quit. very often the game is torture",1,2025-09-27 23:59:48

"My husband asked me to play this game with him. It took 151 matches of Clash Royale to reach tower level 8 which is required to play 2v2. Roughly ten hours of my time invested playing boring matches. At first, the players were unskilled and our decks were evenly matched, fair enough. Then it starts trying to manipulate me, advertising battle passes and chests while matching me against players with cards three or four levels outpacing my own. I hate this, man. I miss paying for games upfront.",1,2025-09-01 10:30:37

"Supercel doesn't care about their community, they have proven this time and time again with every update they release. They are now releasing level 16, adding new hero troops which are busted, adding 2 hero/champion slots, and taking your wild cards and exchanging them for gems, which at the time of this review they have not made the exchange rate public, meaning it will be terrible and they want to rip their players off for as much as they can manage.

Clash royale has changed my life for the better, it has introduced me into a new type of gaming and it has shown me what a real game is like. I love how balanced all the cards are and how every match you get to expereince true sportmanship from your opponents. Unlike other games, clash royale is a very free to play game in which money will not give you an advantage over others. Best game I have ever played and I would recomend it.",5,2025-10-22 21:20:40

There's no excuse for it besides pure greed. the game has more than enough players to queue up with, but they intentionally make you play bots. 26/30 of my battle log matches were against bots.

This is game is so pay to win that you will loose it after a while. I played this game for 4 years in ca 2015-2019 or so. Downloaded it again for a month or so again as i got greedy watching play on youtube. The game play is even more p2w than before. After you play to level 10-11 evolving the cards gets super difficult as free to play. But you will start to play against players (especially in clan wars) that have 2-4 level higher cards than you. It makes it impossible to win no matter what you,3,2025-09-19 01:51:23

megaknight is making this game so toxic. you cannot play one game without seeing it and it makes this game not fun to play. using it also feels so disgusting. people who use megaknight have two braincells and no idea how to play the game. there's nothing good about clash royale because the mk players poisoned the game.

its hard but i like it because its not too hard not too easy its like you can get mad and its like yeah whatever i lost grrrrr.... but i think that this game is very tactical and i like that.,5,2025-12-25 12:30:46
"game is pay to win,no enjoyment what so ever I got lvl 12 and 11 card is clan wars and in normal ranked I dont stand a chance. Merge tactics nah id rather go play solitaire or snake on a Nokia. Never gonna play a supercell game ever. Bye bye support",1,2026-01-13 04:08:09

"I'd give it 5 star if it wasn't so pay to win based. thing is I might just be bad but I cannot get past the jungle arena at all. its like everytime I play the game my team is put up against a hard counter. my account is approximately 6 years old right now. even got a card that is available in the next arena because of it, and yet I still struggle. Amazing game i love it but really needs to balance things out from the pay to win and the normal.",4,2025-09-21 17:19:17
"My 1st mistake was to think this is pvp. It isn't. It's pve and pay to win until you're winning, when the difficulty will miraculously increase until you pay more. Ever notice in merge tactics where it immediately shows the winner, even if you purposely lose first? the other 3 should still be playing to determine their order. except none of them are real players. Don't fall for their garbage and save yourself the time. DO NOT DOWNLOAD. supercell is no different than scammers.",1,2025-09-14 19:52:41
This is a great game love it been playing It since i was young but dont like the fact that they let newer players get a full evo but the people who already past that before they added that dont get that its annoying,5,2025-12-04 04:59:22
"It is a really fun game, but the progression is dog ****. The algorithm will put you up against exact counters to your deck, and so you will lose and lose and lose, until you think the problem is that you haven't payed supercell enough. Once you give them money, you win almost every time. But the game doesn't have ads!!! And it's fun!!! If you're good at the game, you can make it through trophy road, but if not, you have to play classic mode and draft mode for the rest of your life. (probably)🎳",4,2025-11-13 16:34:10
its only fun when ur starting out... you play spend money because ur having fun and having a bit of a challenge while ur playing... then u get paired with unbeatable decks over and over until a new day begins and it will give u 4 games ull be able to win without gaining too many trophies... dont waste ur time or money on this game... if I could put zero stars i would... I dont know why I keep giving this game a chance,1,2025-09-24 10:58:51

"Even though this game is currently going through some hatred yet I love it so much. This game offers you combination of strategy and excitement. Each match feels different. But after all I only have one request for supercell to restart the season shop, coz it was back then our source of leveling up in our own way as we could buy what we need according to our wish. For no season shop, Events have become really unenjoyable and boring.",4,2025-10-07 02:12:59

This game is torture but surely is fun unlocking all thoses new cards. This is a very good strategy game which i strongly recommend if you havent played it as it is so fun for new people whos never played because this brings you face to face with opponents worst/better then you which is very fun to go against. Im out.",5,2025-11-23 06:53:39
"they won't leave the game alone. almost every time I open it there is a new update and they keep adding a bunch of bs stuff that doesn't matter. it used to be simple and fun. now it's just price tags everywhere and useless eye catchers. it's basically pay to play and even then you'll still get the ba popping up, don't recommend. clash of clans is getting just as bad.",1,2025-11-26 09:59:22

"This game might be the most pay to win game in the world. They developed a wonderful game type in which strategy is needed but they ruined this masterpiece with unfair p2w advantages.

"love the game but the firecracker needs to be nerfed. the range it has with the type of evo it has it ridiculous and overused. it makes for too many games with people that spam her behind other troops and with the amount of matches with people that use her cause for more matches that are not fun to play. the game has become less and less about player creativity with the amount of available troops and more about the ""meta"" for every arena. which kills the fun aspect. there's no creativity.",3,2025-11-14 10:08:16
"unbalanced and not scaled correctly makes PVP a nuisance. The devs don't care and mock you in the tips. I am convinced after 5+ years of playing that they integrate bots that will automatically counter any card you have in your deck so you can't go on 5+ win streaks, not to mention you lose more trophies than you get from winning, making it even harder to excel. The only good thing to do is play the classic modes so you don't 'stress' when your whole deck is conveniently countered.",1,2025-09-08 05:03:35
"Even as a newer ( 1 year) player I can clearly see the pay to win and questionable changes adding level sixteen is almost certainly for those who spent money and don't have anything more to buy. The experience of playing ladder is terrible in most promotion matches expect abnormally over levelled opponents. Core idea of the game is great. Good cards, evos, gimmicks but the overleveled commonly braindead meta ruins it something needs to change. The game will die down eventually not worth it.",2,2025-11-18 01:38:32
In an attempt to make the game relevant again you completely ruined it for many users like me and alienated us from the enjoyment we once got.,1,2025-12-21 00:32:10
"Severely declined in quality over the years. The game is so blatantly pay-to-win now that it's ridiculous. They got rid of the loot crate system for daily rewards that used to be a pretty flexible way to manage your rewards from playing. They replaced it with a system that will only reward you for winning three battles in a day. So the only incentive to continue playing the game is a thrice-a-day handout that most likely contains cards you already have? Message received, Supercell 👌",1,2025-10-03 23:12:35

"Supercell's recent game design choices and actions display CLEARLY that they no longer care about player enjoyment and instead only care about the user's wallet contents. I have made the mistake of misclicking the pass royale icon. CR proceeds to autocharge my account $12 without an ""are you sure?"" response. In addition Supercell utilizes a strict no refund policy and makes it nigh impossible to contact them. Sad to see a used to be good company stop caring.",1,2025-09-05 06:33:48

"Clash Royale disappoints due to two main issues: First, the pay-to-win model. Players who spend money have a clear advantage, making the game unfair for those who don’t pay. Second, the unbalanced matchmaking system. You constantly face opponents with much stronger cards and higher levels, which makes the game frustrating and unfair. Overall, Clash Royale cannot be recommended because of these two aspects.",1,2025-11-12 02:49:29
"Great game, just pay to win issues. although, with patience you can play enough to win Its just a lot of time. Im currently 9500 trophies which isn't crazy good, but enough to have been around the block a few times. Only issues is this and eventually you start battling the same old decks. Because people just start looking up whats working or other alternatives. With the main one just being a hog rider & firecracker. The firecracker card is the definition of broken. It just takes away some fun.",3,2025-11-02 14:58:58
"I have played the game for about 5 years now and am trying my best to stay positive while doing so. As of 2025 more players have started playing the game and seeing this supercell have been maximizing the amount of money they can get out of players, some of my reasons include the posting of broken evolutions along with broken cards the problem with that is that is what determines the meta and what top ladder is going to look like this leads to f2p players like myself verse these decks non stop.",1,2025-09-11 11:59:23

"too many nerds + p2w means I'm constantly going up against cards 4 levels higher than mine and evos that I've never seen before with wildly unfair mechanics. the gameplay would be fun if it was even remotely balanced, or if new arenas were easier to reach, but it's just getting a lucky winstreak (which gets reversed quickly by the matchmaker somehow finding 6 perfect counter-decks in a row with high level cards, played by insanely good players).",2,2025-11-08 23:36:45

"Overall its a really good game, however i have many complains towards Supercell, this is becasue the game is not pay to win but pay to survive, in the sense that you will not progress through the game if you dont spend money, and how also as F2P you play against full level 15s in arena 10 which goes against the natural progression of the game. The adding of level 16 is going to destroy this game for F2P, and it annoys me how Supercell have made such a good game, but are going to ruin it.",3,2025-11-15 17:40:27
"Nobody wants level 16. How this dev team is this incompetent is beyond me. First you delete the season shop (a horrible decision), then you make free to play all but impossible by cutting their rewards in half, constant nerfs to pay to win options, and now you're adding yet another level that doesn't do anything but stat increases... I like this game, but trying to play when evos exist but are nearly impossible to get free to play, everyone is higher level and you lose. When 16 drops, I'm done.",1,2025-11-14 02:05:26

"This game is very addicting at first. However, when i kept playing and advancing arenas, i started to realise the algorithm of this game. Whenever I am just a win away from the next arena, I get put up against a more skilled opponent and then end up on a losing streak, then aim to come back and win again then advance to the next arena resulting in me playing more games.

The game would be fun if they didn't sell out.",1,2025-11-22 12:40:26
This is an example of a good game with people who make horrible decisions. The game is at a all time high since like 2020 and what do they decide to do? Add level 16 and heros that NOBODY asked for. There was no reason to add these two things and it made my expirence turn horrible. It was getting fun again but now im uninstalling.,2,2025-11-27 04:51:24

"It's good. But there are some overleveled players, annoying players , and players using non skilled decks. Another thing the trophies system is bad. For example you lost to an overleveled player guess what you lose 32 but when you win you gain like 28. And the last part is when you keep loosing it gives you a player that has no clan so ussualy its a bot.",1,2025-09-30 22:19:11

"Please give me a balanced opponent, this game is not a strategy game in my opinion, it's a P2W game. If you have money, you can play comfortably in this game. Okay, I can accept that, but at least please choose an opponent who is balanced, not one with too big a difference. I'm level 13, I meet opponents above me twice as often.",1,2025-11-12 23:12:07

"One of the least fun games to ever play. Genuinely you cant have any fun or even do anything if you dont spend a hundred bucks to max out your deck. And not to mention all the broken evolutions that come out every months so they can make more money off of their players, only to nerf that evolution to the ground after the season ends. It's a great idea with immaculate potential, but gets ruined by the p2w factor.",1,2025-11-23 04:19:18
I've been playing this game for only about 5 days and it's AMAZING. first their great graphics and gameplay. second the way it feels to win is amazing because it requires concentration prediction but the game makes it fun. sure it's frustrating when you go on a losing streak but then when you get a win it the best. recommend,5,2025-11-17 04:49:04
the matchmaking is a scam. they give you opponents so your win rate will stay at 50%. very greedy company doesn't care about the fan base. the game is fun and addictive,1,2026-01-14 12:44:45
"The game's awesome, real-time strategy matches, all the characters have a wonderful design, their mechanics are too various, aslo is very nice that the games are too short and dynamic. Overall is one of the greatest movil games but it has a few problems that makes the game worst like, slow progression system, unfair matches in low Arenas, not many ways to get progression stuff. If they fix all of these things the game will improve even more.",4,2025-09-30 10:59:01

"this game is beyond repair. you switch up your deck and automatically go against your hard counter, and when you take away cards, you go against decks you should have beat with the cards you just took out.. Not to mention the waves of bots they will put you against. coincidentally, all of them will be your hard counter. The game always seems to have some type of broken mechanics. either cant process what to attack or hits wont register. it use to be fun but now its annoying",3,2025-09-18 05:26:31
I think that this game is to pay to win because I used like 20 bucks to get lvl 14 barbs and I used like 10 for evo megaknight and i only played for 2 months and I'm at 6k smt trophies,3,2026-01-11 01:59:32
at first I thought the game was fun and actually a Pvp game but I now realize it isn't at all. I first noticed how my meter was moving as slow as molasses while the other player was pumping out so fast and I mean heavy hitters not just a bunch of 1 or 2s. then the one game I played took all the doubt away. I was playing a game and we all have a max of 10 and in less than 10 sec they came with a mega knight (6) bats (2) a second mega knight (6) and a sparky (6) mathematically impossible.,1,2025-10-21 06:20:33

"Unless you're willing to spend an ungodly amount of money to progress, don't waste your time. It was fun and playable at one time, but it's long since passed. Every good gimmick is locked behind $5-20 at a time, and unless you're willing to subsequently pay to keep up with card upgrades, you're going to get smeared by disproportionately leveled opponents.",1,2025-12-08 00:06:28
"This game is the pure definition of pay to win. Got to 7500 trophies and can't do anything, I lose constantly not because of bad gameplay but because the cards I put down which should be a hard counter are immediately killed by their level 15 troops. Everyone I go up against is a higher king tower level than me putting me at an immediate disadvantage before the game even starts. After a point, the only way to win is to pay real money to upgrade your cards. P2W. Fix the game supercell.",1,2025-11-22 00:46:14

"I love this game. It is truly one of the best skill based games out there. However, Supercell has not been making very good choices over the past few months. Removing chests, removing the season shop, adding the vine spell and new Evolutions that completely break the game until they are nerfed into the ground, but not nerfing cards like prince that have needed a nerf for years are some examples. All of these changes just made it harder for free to play players to keep playing. Justice for f2p!",2,2025-09-04 07:06:05
"Somehow worse than the last time I played. Evo cards place a clear divide between those with and those without. Unless you are willing to pay for them, or grind through months of having a clear disadvantage, or just accept that you aren't playing to win, this game isn't for you. Especially if you are a returning player having to face other higher-level players with these evolutions. Pay-to-win. I can't in good conscience recommend this game to anybody.",1,2025-11-03 23:32:28
"horrible match-up, handicap after winning a couple of games and pay-to-win issues. it’s insane how I have spent a week playing this and I have my cards at level 7 and I get into a match-up with someone that has their king tower 2 levels above mine and cards way more advanced in level because they are matching up a 1 week account with a 4-6 years one. I do not recommend this game if you dislike these kind of match-making.",1,2025-09-26 03:19:40

Second is that this game is insanely dependent on really good and stable wi-fi. If your Internet drops by half a bar, you lost the match.",4,2025-09-18 08:10:26

"listen, I have been playing this game since 2018, and it has had its ups and downs. However, one thing that hasn't changed is the rigging. You can truly be the best let's say hog player in the world, but you will get matched up with megaknight and mini pekka 10 times in a row, like me. It is just unexeptable but I understand why they do it. Supercell is the greediest company on the market right now and I don't believe that will change for a while.I suggest playing until 6k trophies then quitting",1,2025-09-19 05:35:12
it's fun but it such a pay to win game after every 3 wins there's more losses only when u get the pass is that u win a lot more( this mostly happens in arena 18 and 19),1,2026-01-03 03:51:20
This game is absolutely terrible and pay-to-win. I feel that you should be able to choose any card rather than have to face people who have spent money on this game. The only good modes don't reward you or let you unlock cards making them meaningless. I would rather watch my favorite sports team lose for 8 years straight than play this game.,1,2025-09-09 03:48:22
"8/10 personal opinion. been playing the game for 6+ years at the moment, taken many breaks in the middle. the game screams pay to win but c'mon it's not impossible and pretty fun to play! only problem is if you don't spend, you can't upgrade cards quick enough and me at level 14 and 8000 trophies i have only 2 cards level 14 and 10 ish at 13, rest all under leveled which is annoying.",5,2025-10-04 22:31:11
"I've loved this game for a long time, and put up with so much bs over the years, staying loyal to this ruined cash grab. But this update was my last straw.

It's now impossible to progress. Uninstalled",1,2025-11-25 06:41:15

"Even after the update, Merge Tactics remains as bad as ever. My one complaint about the game was how they likely pre-decide the winner and the rest of the players simply do not get the relevant characters for an upgrade. The new update did not seem to change my perception at all. I mean, at least provide a level playing field and see how the players fare. If only a few players keep getting upgrades, the wins aren't that satisfactory for them too, lol.",1,2025-10-26 14:27:00

Fun game when you first start out but after you get to a point in the game it just becomes pay to win lost 19 games in a row because of people who bought out the whole shop. If the game would put limits on the amount of stuff you can buy at a time it would be a lot better and with the release of heros and level 16 it just made the game impossible.,2,2025-12-30 11:13:10

I was playing this from last 8 years but suddenly a hacker came and hacked my Supercell id i was so frustrated my coc and cr account got vanished i hate this company dude. My one of the dream was to visit or work for Supercell company but now i started hating this company just because there support and customer service.

This game is so pay-to-win and unbalanced. U can pay to max out your cards as soon as you want whenever you want. and if you don't want to pay money. You have to wait years to even get one card maxed. The unbalanced part comes in when they decide to come out with a new evolution and make it completely overpowered the first month then completely nerf it to the ground after that so supercell can get its money.

The worst game ever first of all when you play a match it gives you opponents that have way better cards than you and higher level it's a very pay 2 win game and second when you play 2vs2 always the random that you have plays very bad and doesn't even play he stays afk the entire game and all opponents are very toxic. This game on my opinion needs to fix a lot of things it needs to make it less pay 2 win and when you lose a match it needs to give you an easier opponent.,1,2025-11-16 14:24:18
THE WORST CARD LEVELING AND MOST PAY 2 WIN GAME TO EVER EXIST. It is horrendous. im chill when u can by items or skins in a shop that would give A LITTLE BOOST. However when u can LITTERALLY BUY CARDS TO GET MAXXED EVOS WHEN OTHER PEOPLE HAVE LEVEL 11 CARDS. IT SHOULD BE ILLRAGAL. this is literally a HUGE CASH GRAB. supercell even wants to remove books and wild cards AND ADD LEVEL SIXTEEN. This doesn't even create a skill game it is literally a pay 2 win gap. THEY EARNED 5.8 BILLION OFF THIS.,1,2025-11-13 01:16:01

I really like this game I've been playing for 2 years but it seams that all they want is money and they don't even listen to the player base they added level 16 which no one wanted and removed book so you can only upgrade if you spend money. It's not a problem if you need to spend a little money but u shouldn't need to spend 100-200 dollars to play comfortably. It's like they want to kill the game.

"This game is completely rigged. When I put a goblin tower, no one attacks it. Idk if this is a glitch or not but it's very unfair bc it's one of the cards I use the most.

It makes it people in lower arenas have a harder time winning matches because these pay to play people swoop in and destroy my tower with a evolution baby dragon. It could lead people to quiting.

"A complete mess being designed only for the top paying whales who will let Supercell do anything they want. it was already a daunting task being a returning F2P player but with the complete gutting of the progression system with even more removals coming, including the removal of magic coin and the books of cards items, with the announced card level 16 on the way, you'd be lucky to make it anywhere in this pay to experience nightmare designed to keep you as close to the bottom as possible.",1,2025-11-11 01:51:08
"The game in general is fun and was almost perfect. However with the release of wild cards (an item that lets you level up a card of the same rarity), the game has become pay to win. You cannot avoid this since you are put against people with the same trophy level. This means that you'll lose matches regardless if you have skill or not. This game is supposed to be about strategy, but at this point it's more about who's willing to pay more money in leveling up their card deck.",1,2025-09-23 11:36:55

this game has become very pay 2 win and it is impossible to pick this game up at the moment. Everybody has 3-4 level higher cards than me. Unless the game is balanced again i won't really be having fun. My friends who payed grew expnentially fast and i couldn't keep up.,1,2025-10-04 22:51:23
"The game is really fun, addictive, and well-made. But sometimes it feels like you need to spend money to progress faster — especially when facing opponents who boosted their cards with purchases.

Please make your game better.",3,2025-09-30 06:39:05
i have been playing this game since its launch... about 9 years ago. Was one of my favourite games. However over the last few years the game became so much pay to win is incredible. You cannot compete without spending as you cant keep up with the new cards and new evolutions. Also it is so obvious that once you start winning the game gives you the worst matchups in order to go down again. Its a never ending cycle. I just deteleted it and i strongly advise to stay away from this game.,1,2025-09-12 22:51:06

I continued to play and now I am ""maxed out"" on reward chest. This is very discouraging to me as I PAID for the extra rewards...

"The game is a fun enjoyable fighting game but sometimes its unfair as you level up arenas you can find commonly players that bought stronger cards than you or etc. Honestly its annoying because they can spam it too if the elixir went two times faster at the end of the battle if someone still didnt win, makes you loose your patience with them. As you level up arenas you will find them more and loose your crowns. I understand that the game makes profit from that but its annoying.",2,2025-10-04 08:57:32
"Ive returned after two years to see all of my issues with matchmaking still remains. The game is still wildly unbalanced with a heavy emphasis on pay to win. I was able to climb roughly two arenas before being met with players two castle levels below using cards 1-2 levels above my own. The TFT knockoff was fun but is so unbalanced that two comps win any match up, its a battle of who gets it first. I still strongly suggest not playing the game and have had a regrettable time playing this slop.",1,2025-09-01 16:06:20

"Clash is fun but sometimes it is too complicated and l dont understand this game. When you first started, it's really boring and easy, but when you get more trophies, it's more fun and competitive. l recommend this game to strategic game lovers because you need to use your brain often.Clash royale is also pay to win so dont get too addicted (: have fun and enjoy supercells fun game, l play brawl stars which is another game of supercell and it is also fun,it takes no skill and it is fair.

This is because supercell might be the most greedy company I've ever seen turning literally every component of this game into pay to win.

The matchmaking in ladder is always against you when your gonna get to a new arena.

All in all, its goodd but could use a few reworks.",3,2025-11-03 19:04:05

I could play it for hours on end, 2nd off. balanced. from all of their cards, + their counters. for example! the epic skeleton army, they can be used to easily take down units like the hog rider and the giant. and the counters like wizard, the Valkyrie, and the bomb thrower/tower and skeleton giant's bomb. it's really fun and I recommend it to all.",5,2025-11-23 23:54:40

"this game is actually pretty good, until you get over mid-ladder. All I come across is level 15 hog Riders and pekkas when I play. And that isn't even the worst part. This game takes up way too much storage on my phone that every time this game needs an update I have to delete at least 2 other apps just so it can update.

I checked my internet connection and it had good bars to play. its been twice in a row where in the middle of a match ive gotten disconnected, and these are in challenges where I pay gems to play.

"This game sucks. The ranking point system is dumb. Leveling up cards is just a way for them to make money off of gambling addicts. The matchmaking is bogus and feels like it is rigged to make you lose so will spend money to win.

Worst game ever. 80% of the games I played above 10k trophies are full of bots that play beat down and you can't do anything to stop them and when you play with a real person it's someone who has everything maxed and plays the stupidest combo of card that makes you want to throw your phone through a wall and if I could I would give this game 0 stars.And every second season add a super broken evolution that makes the game unplayable.,1,2025-10-25 13:51:58

Used to be rated 5 stars many years ago but recently had to change due to absolutely no help coming from the team. My account was hacked and they changed all of my info so I try and go through their channels of using the bot that never works then they say try the bot again before we can help then they just never respond back.

"trash game . game made for players who spend money . the game is addictive at the start and then you will slowly realize this game is truly unbalanced , this is because of the evolution cards that are overpowered. the times before evolution was fun players built their own strategy and skills but now build a High elixir deck and 3 crown the enemy in one push ( beatdown decks). unstoppable. for the others who think it's a skill issue let me tell you that no matter what ur defense needs some cash",1,2025-10-07 00:10:08

Two main sources of free progression are now gone, not to mention nostalgia of chests. Supercell, fix these things, and I might give a better review.

"I really liked this game despite the p2w vibes but then they added both lvl 16 and added heroes. heroes are just champions but harder to unlock and the knight hero in particul is purposely overturned so they can milk money and ruins so many decks. The devs can't decide what they want to do they'll add a new mechanic and then add to it for a couple months before forgetting it. tower troops, champions,star points, evos and now heroes. the devs have the attention span of a toddler.",1,2025-11-25 00:25:44

This game is not playable anymore. The same scenario happens every single season they release a new evolution they make it so strong and nerf the other evolutions so that you have to buy the new evolution but after the season it gets nerfed so bad that it's not playable anymore so basically it's a waste of money. These continuous nerfs make the game so bad because you have to track every nerf after every single season to know if the cards are playable or not which makes the game not even fun,1,2025-09-20 20:53:24

"Love the game. I have put many hours and money in it. However, the new season just dropped(rock & rule) and all the minor issues are very frustrating. First: you still haven't fixed the best season bug why should I even push after ultimate champion when the score just gets deleted from my account🤔. Second: you only apply regional pricing to some of my alt accounts so I am basically getting scammed if I buy stuff on my main account and I can't even donate the cheaper pass TO MYSELF.",3,2025-10-06 20:44:32

fun game but can be incrediably aggravating. started playing back at launch and loved it. took a break and was still fun but the p2w is kinda out of control.

This last update completely killed the game. Development team clearly cares more about making a quick buck rather than having it be a good game. They knew this last update would do this but they didn't care and would rather have an additional gimmick for players to give them money for just so that they dont waste all of the progress in the game so far. 1/5 stars please pay an additional monthly fee every month to obtain more stars.,1,2025-11-25 04:53:38

So pay to win. Level 15 cant be obtained without paying. I lose only to decks that are all level 15. Evolutions are so pay to win. It's impossible to get them without paying or waiting 3 months for the free pass. Ts is so boring I just play against every deck that counters me. Litterally the second I change decks the matchmaking puts me against a full counter. Genuinely hate living with this game in the world. Most greedy company ever. I cannot describe how much I hate this game because of P2W.,1,2025-09-16 01:08:29

the tutorial was great and has very friendly people and battles.

The actual gameplay is decent but is extremely unfair. They purposely make you go against players with decks that counter yours and against higher level cards so you lose more and get mad for losing crowns and then play more to try and recover the crowns you lost. It's also pay to win since you can buy stuff to level your cards and have an advantage against players with the same cards.

"Its just pay to win. People can spend hundreds of dollars to max out decks in lower arenas, which they do often. It doesnt get better with time. Matchmaking doesnt take card levels into account. I have now faced multiple level 10 king tower opponents with level 13+ decks (usually megaknight) and nothing changes. its been like this for months and the devs will never solve this issue because theyre too worried about money.",1,2025-10-04 06:51:47
"It's a great game, actually, but in this new update, it became so pay 2 win that it got unplayable. every 2 matches, I get a battle pass oponent that has at least 2 level 16 cards and completely destroys strategies that would work normally to counter the card. it's probably the most pay 2 win game I've ever played, and I really liked it before it became this, but now it's just disappointing to see how greedy supercell is.",2,2025-12-25 15:59:40
played game for years! great game just takes time to build up what troops people actually enjoy. but very good game 💯,5,2026-02-10 05:14:24
"This game has been my favorite since its launch because of how interesting the game is, it requires skill, and balance changes are available making its meta shift therefore its more fun, sadly it's now pay to win, the mad value you get when you pay like 3-5 dollars is pretty unreal making it better to pay 5 dollars than to play for a month. This game's potential is big, but lacking some balance to what you get when you pay Update 4 years later : this game is broken I hate it................10/10",5,2025-11-30 00:15:23

"Unbalanced, pay to win, and not a fun game to play when the matchmaking is terrible. Matching up with players with PASS ROYALE proved that this game is pay to win. It has so much potential to be balanced, but it's been years and no action has been taken upon it.",1,2025-09-19 22:04:12
"Horrible. It's like every single update they make is carefully designed to screw over its playerbase even further. Broken cards, unnecessary nerfs, and removing features that had no reason to leave. If you aren't willing to use your credit card for everything, do not play this game. Also, Add back season shop.",1,2025-08-31 00:07:04
"It is a terrible game do not install this game, if you want to play the game and win you have to spend at least 500 dollars. if you are seriously thinking about installing this game and having fun you need 500-800 dollars to spend and you need to play for 5 hours a day, DO NOT INSTALL!!!",1,2025-10-10 01:08:59
"I love the game, but seriously the overly aggressive algorithm pits you against players who are usually ranked way above you in terms of skill and troop level. This makes it a utter slog to advance. E.g. You lose 3 times and win once because you're consistently and unfairly matched with more elite players.",3,2025-10-03 09:12:39
"This is the epitome of degenerative gaming slop that only wants to make money. The matchmaking and P2W aspects are enough for a man to go clinically insane. 10 trophies away from Arena 17 and next thing you know, the opponent has level 15s and a level 13 king tower. It truly is an embarrassment for mobile gaming. Only reason I'm giving two stars is that it's still bearable from time to time. But I'd recommend CoC, not this shameless attempt at cash-grabbing",2,2025-11-11 20:37:18

it's a really fun game but after arena 15 the game is pay to win with evolutions and you start getting angry if you are free to play,4,2026-01-09 19:10:59
"with the addition of evolutions, it has become an essential part of winning the game. The problem is, its extremely hard for f2p players to get evo shards. I have been playing for so long and I've never gotten a shard from a lucky drop. Never. So considering this, they give two evo shards if you complete the pass royale, so 3 seasons for one evolution? Come on supercell.",3,2025-10-05 14:45:28
"Still crashes reliably on my rooted phone, without any explanation as to why. Updates via any application store other than Google Play are failing more often lately. Still has great core gameplay, but the developers are either lazy or complicit with Google overreach.",1,2025-09-30 07:32:08
"All in all, pay to win unless your maxed leveled which takes years. Every other update it gets harder to progress without paying money. Event rewards are often less worth then a single chest. The current seasonal Chests can turn into a 5 Star and give you a Banner that you already gain as the next reward. Fun concept destroyed by micro transactions and focus on profit. Very rare bugs but loosing a rare drop with important progress is crushing, support can't even react after months. Disappointed",2,2025-10-22 09:28:58
"This is such an addctive game. there is no ads, beautiful graphics, beautifull game designs and a fun game. 5 stars is well deserved!!",5,2025-11-27 00:01:27
"would give it 5, but they take away merge tactics for a season after it appears. Just keep merge tactics permantly. Why get rid of it? It's the only reason i have the app downloaded. The evolutions are a little OP and a grind to get a lot of them if you don't pay. Thirdly, you can't edit your war deck for 24 hours after you use it. How am I supposed to adjust my deck if I forget what I needed from my battle 24 hours ago, and the matchmaking is dumb when my lvl 12 cards are up against lvl 15.",2,2025-11-04 11:52:35
"This game is the most absolute putrid garbage that you can download. I've been on this game for 7 years now. I am a high rank I have max trophies and let me say that this game has turned into the most disgusting pay to win no skill trash I've seen in a long time. winning isn't satisfying, loosing isn't a skill issue. the devs should be ashamed and the community is brain washed into the gotcha micro transactions that make up the majority of this abysmal insult to the game it once was.",1,2025-10-10 23:47:53
"its 2017 Awesome it is the best game I've ever played its now 2019 and its still one of the best games I ever played it's now 2021 and still my favorite mobile game, it's officially the last quarter of 2025 and they have ruined the game its terrible they remove things that people love when there's no reason things play well and besides a few balance changes the game should have been left alone but the adding and rearranging of gamemodes has finally killed the fun of the game after 10 years",1,2025-10-01 00:43:02
this game really sucks to play. I end up playing people that are either overleveled or cheating probably because they can't win any other way.,1,2026-01-11 02:45:13
bro this game use to be actually good until they just didn't care anymore bc level 16 is just stupid then pekka just becomes level 24 like what is this this game is so bad now only if it was like the old ways it would.be fun agiann this game is just bad now,1,2025-12-02 09:10:45
"This is the worst game I've ever played. This game is pay-to-win, and the bots are really irritating. We can defeat real players, but bots come with the same deck and same troops, which is very annoying and difficult to defeat. Please, developer, do some real work, not bots.",1,2025-11-14 19:40:30
"Something is going wrong with the latest updates, in merge tactics my troops will change randomly from what they were as soon as the deploy phase starts. It only seems to happen in the mode where the merger changes the cards to a 1 elixir cost higher unit, it is ruining the gameplay.",3,2025-10-16 17:28:02
"In the new game mode ‘Merge Tactics,’ I noticed something strange. When I finish in 4th place and get knocked out early, the game already shows me who finished 1st, 2nd, and 3rd — even though the match is still going on. How is that possible? Does the game decide the winners as soon as the match starts?",4,2025-10-03 21:48:59
sad to see another game franchise that once provided a fun free to play game with lots of content fall to corp greed. now if you want to get anywhere in CASH royal you've got to pay to play. I was never some elite player who won round to round but now it's become impossible to advance without dropping money. I've played for 9 years and have the badge to prove it. Do better. it's what veteran players want. not what this game's become.,2,2025-10-16 14:21:06
"I have an account with 10k trophies and was on my back up & after nearly 100 matches played AND documented at 9800 trophies, I've found that the matchmaking process is designed to put you against players that have decks that counter the one you're currently running to keep you from progressing forward to 10k trophies. 89/100 matches had perfect counters for every deck I ran and I used the 10 most successful decks. 10 battles each deck. The 11 other battles were bot battles. Absolutely horrible.",1,2025-09-09 16:19:44

"Supercell, I have played the game for almost 4 years. I can say you have changed the game for the worse as a f2p. You add all of these new cards and evolutions, but you make them harder and harder to obtain. I enjoy the addition of Lucky Drops to earn these, but feel that the game was most fun as a f2p when we earned chests for each game and 3 Lucky Drops daily. On top of that, having the Daily Shop brought back will make those limited modes more fun to play. Thank You",4,2025-08-26 21:46:22
"this game is so godamn pay to win, by the time you reach arena 15 you'll see so many overleveled cards that you are basically rage playing.",3,2025-12-22 18:03:53
"I like the gameplay and find it fun! That said, rewards are getting worse (the question mark boxes suck and are overtaking loot chests on daily rewards), and it is getting to be more pay-to-win with the introduction of evos. It's not too horrible at the moment and doesn't take too much money (you'd be fine with like $10-$15 a month), but want this standard and downward trend understood before new people try the game. Honestly, probably wouldn't have reviewed if not for the daily chests change",3,2025-09-28 02:58:24
"it's fun in the beginning, but as you go up further, it gets more competitive. even if you change a card, the game will place with someone who knows how to counter you. it's easy to pay to win, and the bridge just is too small. It makes every game feel the same win or lose. party mode is the only fun one.",1,2025-09-30 02:46:44
About time I'm liking it(2016). edit: years later I gave up on supercell at this point. when clash Royale switched to the setup and gameplay it is at now a while back I uninstalled this game. I tried to reinstall and give it another shot just to uninstall it again. I wish it never would've changed IDK why it changed it was perfect how it was before we had to do all the extra stuff and battle from ships and everything else. I miss the good ol days. distant memory now though sigh 😔 (2025),1,2025-10-06 08:55:17
super fun but i feel like the matchups are to hard after a few wins like the have the perfect counter to my deck. super fun but a bit P 2W,5,2025-12-16 21:22:43
pay to win. Absolutely pay to win. I am getting player 2 level higher than me. I am almost always on a losing streak. this will soon be a dead game,1,2025-12-15 16:31:11
if you dont pay for stuff this game good luck. I've spent no money so far and skill and strategy can only do so much. i buy every card in the store and upgrade with gems to even the field. if I go into a game where every card they have has 1 level on me I automatically chalk that up as a loss. A friend that has spent some money and a long time playing this game told me good luck catching up to him. hes around 9000 trophies and he projects itll take atleast a year to reach him if not longer.,1,2026-02-12 19:54:25
"Been playing for few years now. loved it, hated it. updates have taken away from the game, the shop going was one of the worst, but the daily challenge going was a good one. I play longer now. without the shop, can't get Evo shards, and advance your deck very well. you have little conroll over what characters you can advance now. most of my deck is flashing green. no incentive to level up card not in decks. but want my deck level 15. can't tho. also can't play. up date. too big. need 3+gig? wow!",3,2025-10-26 03:13:25
"Great game. However, when it decides there is no signal, it fails miserably. I lost signal at the end of a match, with a lot of units on my opponents king tower. In it's glitchy, no-signal way, it said I had won the match, and began to put up the crows-on-cusions page. Then, apparently, I had lost that match, and my opponent had somehow managed to defeat around a fifteen elixir attack on their king tower, which only had six hundred health, and played megaknight and several ranged units.",3,2025-10-21 21:18:44

"I deleted my fairly scathing review, and after returning to this game years later, they have actually fixed a lot of the old problems and made the game a bit better for f2p, and lowered prices by a lot on p2w stuff. I know we won't realistically ever get a ""perfect game"" from any dev team, but when I see the dev team actually address some issues, despite waiting so long that they killed their super popular game, it does give hope. I hope more changes and adjustments are incoming.",5,2025-10-29 17:06:35
what absolute greed does to a great game. they completely butchered the rewards system and are trying to serve its scraps back to us. you loved getting the huge chests after winning a game? lol not anymore. your now limited to 4 whole daily chests that only give you 1 single random card or it could be only gold. you thought this game was pay to win before then dont even bother trying to think about the game now. the devs are just money hungry (bad word) people. ruined an amazing game.,1,2025-10-28 01:08:07
Way too many p2w (pay to win) players but otherwise it's a game of strategy and climbing up the ranks.,4,2025-12-28 19:03:14
"luck based game, it's up to fate if you win 90% of the time. matchmaking needs work, I'm a free to play and i get put against level 15 pay to win/sweat lords. half the cards are terrible to use, and the other have are terrible to face as they're just annoying in general. this game is the complete opposite of most where it gets worse the more you play. The only enjoyment I get is beating an annoying player and getting to laugh in his face, but other than that, I would not recommend EVER.",1,2025-11-22 06:20:40
I love this game and all but every single time and I'm playing the match most of the time I don't run into pay to win players but a lot of times I am I am sick and tired of these pay to win players not being sent to very high arenas like all they are doing is ruining the game the same cards every few seconds like SUPERCELL FIX THIS LIKE YOU GUYS RUINED THE GAME SO QUICK WHEN IT GOT POPULAR,3,2025-11-22 06:10:30
Worst game ever if you win one match you will definately loose second either it will show network issues even in top speed or send decks of too much high level. worst game,1,2025-12-03 22:07:40
nice game but u have to be very strategic not to waste elixir and don't put random cards always think of a technique that can u can use to outsmart the opponent,5,2025-12-19 22:13:44

The game is great in general it's really competitive and it will help you control your stress even if you're under pressure. additionally I will really recommend this game if you want to spend time. But I always have a problem with this glitch I can't see if my mutuals are online and I'm upset about it because I can't play against them which is also what I enjoy playing with. I already checked if it was the Internet and it wasn't. so I would really appreciate it you can fix this please and thx!,5,2025-10-17 06:06:21
used to be a great game. now its literally just pay to win. dont have heroes? money to buy cards to upgrade? no evolution cards? you cant compete. its not fair.,1,2025-12-01 06:36:22
this game is really bad it used to be good but now there are people who make new accounts and spend 300 dollars on the game and easily win. if they want to make the game good remove all micro transactions People can only have one account and levels can direct where people need to be. I am so close to deleting this game since it's not fun people with 15000 crown can just make a new account and play in arena 1 and decimated people who are new to this game.,1,2025-09-24 01:14:41

this game I will say as a concept is good and I enjoyed the game for 8 years and now at this point it's just disrespectful. if you don't have every card level 15 and your in a high arena you just lose straight up. you can't try out any new comps you just have to one trick all the way up. even if you can do that it takes literally years to get a new team all the way 15 and by then they've added 7 new ways to force you to pay in order to compete with other people. this is the most pathetic P2W.,1,2025-09-24 08:45:21

"Love it! the game is so good, but i heard some rumors that when you get to the later arenas., the game gets too hard so Im gonna put it in 4 stars",5,2025-12-16 17:44:11
it was fun at the beginning but anyone who wants to be good at the game already knows that mid ladder is impossible because megaknight was already broken before and they made him even better with an evolution so you basically are forced to use him in order to get high up on the trophy road. they need a rework to make the game better.,1,2025-10-16 07:53:00
"Was once an amazing game that was a little bit of a money grab. Friends rejoined the gaand I remembered my glory days on Clash Royale, so I had to re download. Opened the game and started winning until I ran into the first player using Evos. They are a busted pay to win tactic that ruins the game. I would be winning using strategy like I believed the fame intended until the opponent finally gets the evo used in their deck, and then I get rolled. A bad addition to the game makes it unplayable.",2,2025-08-21 23:11:44
"this game will ruin your whole day, people with over levels beating you, and that happens on BIG level arenas, meaning it makes it on purpose so that you get hooked up and lose, this game's whole idea is to make it so that you have unbeatable opponents, for example you have a full deck of one tap skeletons? well guess what... your opponent conveniently has mother witch, turning all of those skeletons into hogs against you. I tested this multiple times, I'm alr hooked up, don't get urself too.",1,2025-11-24 08:15:32
"I have no clue what you did with the latest updates, but the game keeps crashing over and over again. It's not about ram or network or storage . even before that started the pay to win thing, which really frustrated me to the point where I would delete the whole thing permanently. .",1,2025-10-13 08:03:15
"A very exciting game, but unfortunately it is very unfriendly to F2P players where the gap in card levels and evolution cards with opponents is very large, causing an imbalance between P2W and F2P. Also fix your servers for the Asian region, they're very unstable, making this game even more annoying. Players leave because of the card imbalance in the game, don't let them leave because of the service to. bring back the shop seasons to, mystery box rate is very trash. DON'T BE TOO GREEDY",1,2025-10-01 12:15:26
good game it would be pretty cool to see a mode where all your cards are level 11 but you get random cards every time you place something down,5,2025-11-27 17:43:25

"after the recent update, i have not been able to log in to my account. Every time i open the game, it immediately closes. I genuinely don't know what's going on because this is the first time it's happened after playing this game for nine years. Nothing seems to solve this issue.",1,2025-10-03 02:28:07
can never play the game my screen always goes dark and my opponents always get a 1 tower headstart and it also doesn't update properly.,1,2025-12-22 04:34:07
most pay to win game of all time. To top it off there is no such thing as fun in this game. everyone plays the meta and if you want to try other cards ever that are under leveled you cant because you will instantly be demolished by some meta deck played by a guy who spent $500 on the game,1,2025-10-21 12:35:12

"This became a huge pay to win game, and it's sad. It used to be so good, and know is all microtransactions.",1,2025-12-19 13:04:01
"a game we all once loved, ruined by pay-to-win corporate tactics, and hog spammers, unbalanced matchmaking. The only way to level up cards or get evolutions after reaching 8k trophies is by buying your way through the game, extremely unfair matchmaking makes you want to quit the game, and don't even get me started on hog spammers. Supercell really ruined a genuinely enjoyable game to make it more profitable.",1,2025-10-07 22:55:15
"This game is really fun at first, but the more you level up, the more its pay to win. Shame on the developers. The evo versions for $10 a piece makes it completely unfair to anyone who doesn't want to pay for a stupid mobile game. Definition of pay to win",1,2025-10-08 11:45:10
Heros completely ruined the game making it even more p2w than before. Its just unplayable.,1,2026-02-02 01:31:11
"Best game in the play store hands down.. keeps coming out with new things. Constantly updating new game styles new cards. JUST ALL AROUND AMAZING!!! KEEP IT UP GUYS Edit: New merge tactics they added is the most rushed game play I've ever played... some rounds you get everything you need at every turn, others you get absolutely nothing... one person out of 4 in the round always gets exactly what they need. It feels rushed and nothing has been done to fix the randomize part of the game..",3,2025-09-08 04:32:56
This game is fun strategic and can keep you occopied for a while I really reccomend this if your someone who likes strategic fun games.,5,2025-12-14 02:54:50
"This might possibly be the worst game I have ever played in my entire life. I have never had less fun playing a game than when I play clash Royale. I would genuinely rather play Hello Kitty, my island adventure, than even look in the general direction of clash Royale. This game is so inconceivably bad that it makes me genuinely reconsider even being born. I think I'd have a more enjoyable experience cutting both of my arms off with a rusty spoon than playing this game.",1,2025-10-04 00:39:07
"Fun but one flaw, it is very fun strategy game one of the best but I hate how it is very pay to win which ruins the game by alot other wise 5 stars but all the micro transactions ruin it",3,2025-12-20 06:22:11
"I truly enjoy this game. but fix clan war matchmaking. on average, my opponents cards are 2 levels higher than mine every clan war battle. and its not like it searches for an opponent for several minutes. as soon as I search for a war battle, im matched with someone.",1,2025-11-16 02:17:40
"Edit since THE update: Nerfed F2P so bad that even P2W costs like $1000 to max a deck... Hero cards destroyed the game, $15 for a hero!? Also, no new evos in 2 updates. I can't remember the last time they added a new card. Lucky chests are horrible, the reward never matches the stars. Even the content creators and Pro's are bad talking the game, it's gotten THAT bad. Hate to finally delete this game after 9 years, but this is just horrible.",1,2026-02-04 02:36:01
"garbage waste of time dont believe the hype. It is a very much pay to play which would be ok I dont mind spending money, the issue is the algorithm that controls the match making. if its your time to lose no matter what you play or do change your deck does not matter you lose. it will slow your elixir making down so you can't defend or attack as fast as your opponent. I am level 11 fighting level 9 all my cards are 11s their's level 8s and 9s and still lose. but then win time and you win 8 inrow",1,2025-09-27 06:40:41
used to love this game. played for years. like 7 years. the game is 100 percent play to win garbage now. mini pekka is so buffed its flat out unplayable garbage.,1,2025-12-07 02:06:07

"Terrible for F2P, I'm at 8300 trophies as free to play and if you wanna get high in trophies, you have to use money. Alot",2,2025-12-09 01:54:18
"The Game is EXCELLENT The overall game idea is unique and interesting providing an experience like no other Clash Royale and SUPERCELL did a great job on making the game nd the game is co op and pvp friendly. Two thing that takes away from the game is the ""pay to win"" and the toxicity in each emote which take away from the game experience",5,2025-10-20 07:00:56
1 star for being another cash grab game. either your opponent has been playing the game for years or it's a Smurf acc at low levels. With no protection no wonder it's such a turn off to so many people My friends in top clans spectate and laugh how out of control its at lower lvls. Don't waste your time unless you're going to invest a good chunk of your life or money.,1,2025-09-22 12:26:25
"Warning to parents and players, this game purposely creates rage to make you play or pay more. From the emojis that are geared to gloating, or the fact that if you need a win it will put you purposely against higher level opponents, or those with irritating decks. The psychology is clear, make players angry to make them play and pay more. It is fun, but should have a health warning, the rage it can create is difficult to diffuse, especially in children who start playing happy, then...",3,2025-12-30 16:54:17
it is probably the best animated game ever there are OLMOST no ads and a lot of fun things for all the parents it is not actually that violent and thats why I'm giving it 5 stars,5,2025-12-23 00:32:29
it would be an amazing game if matches didn't have evolved locked behind pay to win. I understand people need to make money off of free games but this is redundant at this point you can't get card but one day at a time and yet you need better cards to make better charters. the old Royale was si much better at least it was balanced and not pay to win ....,1,2025-09-03 13:42:30
"The game is quite exciting, but this should have been thought about from the start. If the signal is bad, a warning should be given before the match so that we can anticipate and avoid defeatnwhile playing in the middle of the game, Even though at the start of the game the signal was good, why did it suddenly lag in the middle of the game? and i hate mega knight",2,2025-10-14 22:13:29
"The game is good but the only problem is with the internet 🛜 connection. It runs smoothly with the same connection during friendly wars and other times but at the time of the main war, it shows weak connection and hence couldn't use troops properly. Kindly look into it.....",2,2025-09-30 22:43:34
"PAY TO WIN👎🏼 you can't get anywhere without spending money anymore. you have to have all max level cards in ranked to get anywhere. you used to get elite wild cards in ranked and now you get a giant chest & a legendary wildcard??? seriously??? y'all know we see how much you profit, right? & this is coming from someone who got the pass. ridiculous and I'm honestly considering being done with the game after playing since it was released.",1,2025-11-06 10:22:39
"The game is really good besides the pay 2 win aspect of it. You could be on lets say like a 10 game win streak and then you get matched up with some 5 year old who used his moms credit card to buy some kind of op card in arena 1. Overall, its really just the pay 2 win aspect and the 5 year olds with absolutley no skill that have exey in arena 2 thats bringing the game down",4,2025-10-04 11:11:28

"They introduced level 15, made the upgrade pay to win, and ruined the game, Glad I don't have to wait for troop to be built, was a Great live strategy game. It took me 3hrs to get your email, you completely stuffed this update in Oct 25.",1,2025-10-21 04:50:25
"they are removing ways for you to get cards for free. Got rid of chest can't earn them anymore, you can only buy them now. knew the game was going down hill when you could buy every evolution card. always on sale always heros for sale trying to force the customer to buy the cards. it's going to take over a year of playing straight to earn all the cards for free. Then not even the fact the everyone and there mom buys up to lvl 15 cards. pay to play game",1,2025-11-03 22:38:05
"what a complete buy to win POS game, I have 100% of the time fought other players that have more than 300 more health than me, all this does is make a player who see's a free to play game that isn't matchmaking friendly to new players get mad. Perfect recipe to create unneeded rage. No matter how much I want to play this game I now have to not play it because I'm not going to purchase anything to have fun. if my health was the same as other new players that would be okay and that would be fair.",5,2025-11-05 06:52:48
"I also play it on my Iphone (I'm on A7 there), and it is no different than playing on my laptop. Props to the game developers, this is a very fun game, but can be stressful at times. It's too fun that I play it during school (when permitted).",5,2025-10-11 23:43:09
Came back to the game and was having fun till I got to around 3500 trophies. Cant get anywhere past it and get put up against people who counter all of my cards every time without fail no matter what I do or how many times I switch things around in my deck. Very rigged and just a waste of time. Would not recommend any new player to waste there time on this game and find something else to pass the time. There is a reason why this game has so many 1 star reviews and they all are similar issues.,1,2025-09-02 02:01:27
This games matchmaking is designed to make you angry. they get your hopes up and let you get as close as possible to the next arena before pairing you with pay to win opponents for the next 5 games which leaves you back at the start. If a game is designed to make me angry to keep me engaged and to try and make me spend money then it's a disgusting games. Do not play this game if you want to enjoy yourself.,1,2025-08-22 14:11:27
this game is really fun but I only have one problem it's the pay to win players it's making it difficult for the free playing players,5,2025-11-25 18:40:48
it had to load multiple times but that's ok. I got to pick a name so that's awesome. the game was very fun.,4,2025-12-07 00:50:39
"If I could give this game zero stars I would. The redeemable features of this game are scarce. On top of an already painfully pay-to-win system and style of play, the community on the game combined with overall technical issues makes the game unenjoyable and nearly unplayable. Overall, incredibly disappointing game.",1,2025-10-02 01:18:17
"dosent give returning people anything and its annoying players also, I can't change my username which i hate because my username is really bad and I don't want other players seeing that username and everything has became pay to win and in the shop 80%, of everything is just stuff you gotta pay for and the shards are impossible to get like you need to reach level 70 just to get 1 shard out of 6 and everything is just bad the players and the game with all of these microtransactions.",1,2025-10-25 11:21:57

"rating this low because ever since the update, the game shows that i have a poor connection even if i have a fast network.",1,2025-12-05 19:42:03
The entire game has come to a point where if you even want to compete you have to spend an absurd amount of money. New cards come out just to get nerfed immediately right after you spend $40 on the bundle. The developers destroy the game just to make money.,1,2025-09-26 06:18:39
Terrible game So bad full of people who have spent money on troops and so the way you get matched to another player is always too difficult. Progressing through the game is so slow 5 years I have had this and still I am deleting due to hatred of the money making bigwigs,1,2025-10-30 18:25:39
"This could be a good game, but some how the winner is decided by the programming instead of the strategy of the players. For some games you cannot keep up with your opponent, because they produce elixir faster somehow, only if you haven't purchased more gems. edit...I deleted this game for a long time. A little while ago I downloaded it again and it is still a lot of fun but it also will not let you win some. So I will delete it again.",1,2025-10-15 11:46:12
"I mean the game is alr, it needs some few tweaks but with the Google play beya for pc. the 2v2 with my discord friend hits hella hard. it's also very nostalgic. like I love played when it was in its beta, and then kinda forgot about it. but now it's Really good. besides the PTW and other bs. I've known that since the beta though. hope this review is helpful! download the game if ya like predictions and skill in some parts.",4,2025-08-30 09:50:14

i mean its a great game dont get me wrong but its pay to win. So when i had like 3800 trophies and everything on level 9 my opponent had boss bandit at level 12,4,2025-11-26 20:27:06

Game completely ruined by hunger for money. F2p experience destroyed by lvl16 can't even win 1 match now. I was rocking 10k+ trophies with my lvl14 deck then now i cant even influence how each my matches play out. Like yeah maybe i could take down a tower but then there is the fact that my opponent has a deck with lvl15-16 cards. i have 2 level 15 cards and they feel useless agains the new level.,1,2025-12-02 18:25:24
lvl 16 seems greedy and is another step towards ftp players never having a chance to touch the game at its highest lvl. the new cards are also looking like money grabs they are always really good fist season and then get nerfed,1,2025-11-26 01:00:13

"Every update makes the game more pay to win and less fun to play overall, the hero update was the last straw. Did you know that at the f2p drop rate of 2 wild shards per month and a total of 39 evos it would take almost 10 years of playing an average of 18 hours a month to get enough wild shards to have all the evos? Nerf mega knight, make evos actually attainable if theyre gonna be this op, and bring back the event shop!",1,2025-11-27 01:51:56
This game had me in 4000$ in dept because I broken 6 phones because of the evo mega kight and I can't take it anymore if you want a game to break 6 phones this is the perfect game and I don't really know why I keep playing this game it's better to watch paint dry than playing this game,5,2025-12-12 20:43:15
its an amazing game! no ads but I recommend making the prices of stuff in the shop lower,5,2025-11-25 21:52:14
now that I've played further in the game it's actually pretty good it's a little pay to win because the company's money hungry but I still like the game.,4,2025-12-17 09:22:31

It's a good game. However its unfortunately consumed by pay to win and broken cards. Megaknight has ruined my experience as an arena 13 player for literal years 😭,3,2025-12-26 10:52:54
Very fun game. VERY pay to win but in midladder its more of a pay to play type of game. Still would recomend.,5,2025-12-22 23:03:33

for your sanity do not get into this game. after the first three months it's all pay to win. the devs hate us and I wish I didn't already invest hundreds of hours into it or else I would quit,1,2025-12-08 13:29:46
Definitely oriented towards whale gamers. Free to play is totally a grind that's not completely worth it.,3,2025-11-28 02:29:22

"Clash Royale keeps lowering its own standards. Level 16? Such an obvious cash-grab. They haven’t even finished Evolution cards and now we get Hero cards? And chest rewards are worse than ever. If you want to climb the ladder, you’d better bring your wallet. Supercell clearly doesn’t care about managing this game anymore.

This new update completed ruined the game. They removed chests and cut basically all the rewards and progression by around 50%. They also removed the season shop which was one of the main ways for free to play players(including myself) to earn evolutions and other rewards. Overall this update sucks and I hope supercell brings back everything they removed.🫤😞,1,2025-08-31 06:53:18

"Has become pay to win and with all the updates, the level playing field no longer exists. Has gone downhill fast",1,2025-12-05 18:49:45
its so bad now supercell just ruined a game that was fun for just a little but by adding level 16 dumb ahh card and making everything pay to win even tho they said its gonna be more f2p supportive,1,2025-12-02 02:32:27
Not bad but very pay to win and very toxic. It does help with mental thinking and problem solving skills but many would argue that its all phone breaking. I personally play chess alot with 2000+ chesscom rating and that makes me learn the game faster and really helps with choices (I win like 80% of my games) I recommend playing chess if you want to improve on clash faster.,3,2025-10-18 12:31:21

i wish there are more masteries and better lvl chest rewards edit: this new update have really bad rewards system like lvl up chest gave 1 rare card and 1 legendary thats so bad i am lvl 45 in this game. update: Worst update ever why did u add lvl 16 if u really want money u should have used skins for each card in the game just copy past from clash of clans that would have been better for both players and supercell😞,1,2025-12-12 01:32:47

really fun for the first arenas but after some time it turns for the worst. Players most of them P2W or using broken decks. the only option to go further not being P2W Is grinding or hoping for a weak player . this game gives that adrenaline rush after every game or makes you rage out on something . there is to mush P2W thing in this game that make you rage when playing against them . I don't really recommend it for the long run,2,2025-09-08 22:07:45
very bad its just a game that if you Don't pay money you loose snd even you you pay they will nerf the cards that you payed for so you have to buy again and it doesnt care about the players it only cares about money,1,2025-12-25 08:23:17

I really like this game. I love it as a matter or fact. the only thing I dislike is that I never get any good drops from Lucky drops compared to my friends and people I see playing the game. my progression is really slow but I am a 8 year to 9 player so I just grind. I wish supercell would show me as much loyalty as I have shown them over the years.,5,2025-09-23 11:13:21
like the game doesn't even makes sense now earlier I used to have so much fun playing this game but in recent times the game has become more pay to win .their was absolutely no need to add heros and level 16 rn.i think this has destroyed the game and no one can fix this now,1,2025-11-26 19:14:57

updating my review to 1 star. this game worsens by the day because of the uncompetitive devs and you money hungry overseers of this game. literally making more promotional offers on the whole screen on every tab rather than making the interface simpler and the user experience tolerable at least. all i see are offers anywhere i look on the screen. there's more ads on the main menu/central log of the game than malice websites for crying out loud! you made one of the best games i've played garbage.,1,2025-10-24 22:27:21
"good game though the combat system for when your getting into matches is stupid. I will go ahead and win two matches and then be put up against someone who has all 10 star cards IN PEKKAS PLAYHOUSE only stage 5??? helloo??!? why Everytime I get a few wins I get out up against an impossible match up? this is so stupid. In my last few games I got 3wins in a row and now am on a losing streak of 7 because of cards that are completely stacked. one deck even had a legendary card, as well as evolution.",2,2025-11-05 16:05:40

I may as well be challenging Bezos to a competition to buy the most imaginary beans in a card game except Bezos relies on money and spamming things that deal damage and cannot be blocked rather than actual strategy like he would if he were a real person. This game has gone from a fun and interesting concept to a casino roulette for children. This is now unplayable for those without throwaway cash. OLD REVIEW: 4 Stars 豆が大好きです。",1,2025-09-13 19:59:53

I have never wrote a review before. But I'm writing this one because this game is AWSOME this is the best game ever. I love competing with friends. I even got my Gf into the game. We both love it and play together all the time. I started playing in September. I just hit Spooky Town (Arena 12). My Gf started playing about 1 week ago and shes in arena 3 (can't remember what its called). We both love this game and we think everyone should play.

"Awesome game, except it's now turned into a P2W game. The latest inclusion of the heroes, and removing of books, EWC also ruined the game structure we have known for the last decades. not only that, they should be focusing on their old ideas to improve the current structure but they proceed to introduce a new structure to the game, which destroys the balance tilting the game into P2W user favour. not to mention the nasty bugs still happening.",2,2026-01-25 23:51:24

This game is much pay to win. You can get up to tower 8 or 9 with rares and legendaries but past that you pretty much either have to have rng on your side and giving you the next epic characters that are broken and overpowered or spend a lot of money to open chest to get them. You can get them without having to buying chest but your chances are slim to none so don't waste your time or money on this game this is still true in 2025,1,2025-10-13 09:10:33

I had 3 in a row this morning. I also don't understand why losing in sudden death by 3 HP nets me the same loss of trophies as I gain for triple crowning in the minute and a half. really makes the trophy grind awful.,2,2025-09-13 07:39:22

"adding level 16 after promising the community they wouldn't lol. It's a great game, the ideas and mechanics are fantastic. But it's really not worth trying as a new player. Increasingly Pay to Progress/Pay to Win.",1,2025-11-12 19:06:10
"a Hello, in my opinion this game is very fun since you can make battles with your friends in different game modes, just like the competitive mode or playing in the clan, at first it is obvious that you have been Difficult, oh it will get boring, but after a while it becomes a competitive game since there are always mini events like challenges, clan wars, climbing arenas, etc., but from my point of view From the 2 years I've been playing, I think it's a very fun game and that's all I have to say.",5,2025-10-26 06:55:48

This games is extremely competitive and I love that. The cards you collect and use is addictive you always want to improve and climb up the areas but one one down fall is you get people that are far far far mpre advanced and the cards level is alot higher than your and its not very easy to get a hit on tower,4,2025-10-24 19:13:37
unfortunately this game has become pay to win just like it's predecessor clash of clans. Dont have the cards you need for upgrade? Don't worry they sell them. Your castle defense is lacking? Don't worry they sell that! It used to be skill based but that time has come and gone. GG to the OG clash royalers it was fun while it lasted.,2,2025-08-22 10:24:30

"actually a horrible game. the balancing sucks, it's almost impossible to get out of midladder, it's so pay to win and almost forces all players to pay if they want to get out of like arena 3. overall one of the worst mobile games I've ever played. if you're thinking of getting it, please don't its just a waste of time and makes you so angry for no reason.",1,2025-10-18 22:25:47

"This game has all the makings of a good game, yet manages to fail in any possible aspect of enjoyment. It very obviously forces you into situations which are unwinnanble, and gives an overwhelming advantage to those who are willing to spend ridiculous amounts of money on this worthless game. Overall, this game has great potential, yet still manages to offer among the worst gameplay I have ever had the misfortune of experiencing, and anyone who gives money to this game should be ashamed.",1,2025-10-18 09:47:48
"The game has improved a lot from the trash state it was in for the last few years. while still very pay to win, progression seems possible again and more enjoyable. performance issues still remain though. My game takes ages to load inbetween matches using my S20 ultra or S24 FE. I've had this issue for years and it is slowly getting worse. I'm pretty much unable to rematch in 2v2 and have to restart the game most times to keep playing.",3,2025-10-02 03:51:48

"if I could give a review lower than this I would, game has become basically every EA game, filled with p2w, you wanna play free to play? too bad, someone is gonna buy the best stuff they can, and every other match you go against someone who has spent 100 bucks on the game and has cards that aren't even unlocked for you yet cause they are arena 13 while you are at 9. don't play unless you have a thousand bucks spare.",1,2025-08-26 07:53:46
"Bad, because like even if they just spend a tiny amount of money, they already get a huge boost in power compared to f2p players like me. I came across player with a deck consisting of level 13 cards in electro valley, and my high level card is 11 even though it seems like a 2 level gap, remember I said a DECK consisting of level 13 I had one card at level 11. I love this game but it's so unenjoyable when you came face to face with a player who spent money to level up and get better cards",1,2025-10-11 08:58:28
there is no way with the millions of players in this game that I somehow will always match up with counter decks. I've changed my deck multiple times when I bump up to next arena I play against the same decks 10 times in a row. I've been playing for 9 years,1,2025-09-30 06:28:45
well I play and win like two games then lose like 3 and then have to continue playing to get it back up and it almost took me a month to get out of an arena so yeah. also it can be really addictive so make sure to take breaks and know when to stop playing because in one day I spent like 7 HOURS on the game and I didn't even know it.,3,2025-08-22 00:56:08
"has this game changed over the years? yes. for the better? surely not. is supercell yet another major, money-hungry, service-slashing corporation hellbent on worsening and bastardising their games to increase profit? yup! but, i will say that i still find profound and unadulterated pleasure in playing this game while on a few milligrams of high quality (R isomer) ketamine! i highly recommend it to any aficionados out there looking for a playful and quiet way to spend their night/high. :^)",4,2025-10-24 08:00:03

I just feel like CR is matching me with hard counters and p2w players like 70% of the time, but this game is good overall mainly because the CR team keeps the game active fun exiting and surprising.

"Clash Royale is amazing because it blends strategy, intensity, and pure competitive excitement into a game that never gets old, and from my own experience it’s the one mobile game I consistently open every day without even thinking about it; every match feels unique, your decisions actually matter, and there’s nothing like the satisfaction of predicting an opponent’s move, defending perfectly, or turning a losing game into a clutch last-second win that makes you feel unstoppable; the fast-paced",5,2025-11-25 02:30:08

"It's fun early game and every once in a while but the further I progress, the more simple and stupidly overpowered decks I find, people have cards they shouldnt from buying them and everything is over leveled. To be called a strategy game is correct to a point where bridge spam and combos that you can use once then sit back and win are all to common. Nevermind, the game is fine even if a little unbalanced but the player base is just awful and needs to grow up",2,2025-09-20 04:21:59

"I've played this game for a very long time. 9+ years. I've seen the good, the bad, and the ugly. I've really enjoyed the game but I have uninstalled the game today with the latest update. It is a blatant play to win scheme, adding a level to cards (now 16), adding hero cards that make busted cards more busted, not to mention the plethora of evos and champions that make the game a bit broken. They are no longer trying to hide the fact that the game has always been pay to win/play 😥",1,2025-11-25 06:09:14

I love it, I've played it for years, but come on Supercell, you've completely ruined this game. it's impossible to enjoy it in higher arenas without getting completely destroyed by either bots with a hard counter for your deck, or p2w players that make free to play players completely outmatched.

I hate every time that I lose to a pay to win loser because they have way better cards and it's way easier for them to counter my deck because of higher level and they buy cards that you can't unlock if you're in a lower league there's nothing I can do to counter their deck they should add a feature where you shouldn't lose trophies to people who have higher level cards and people who paid for evos. I'm only on league 3 💀 and already battling people with evos but besides that the game is fun,3,2025-09-01 13:11:08

From adding card evolutions to adding the functionality to use 2 champions in one deck, this game is horrible.

Game expects you to keep spending money with no reward. Made it to the highest level in the game and still getting beat by players several levels below me. Game is totally controlled. Supercell decides when and how you progress in the game. STILL GARBAGE... PC version is broke. Crashes constantly. Customer support keeps repeating their responses and is no help.,1,2025-10-07 04:55:49
I love how it consumed almost no data so you can easily play on the go however everything like the pass has gotten more expensive and pay to win in the past years. I still like it ish and play it sometimes but I would be way more likely if it wasn't as pay to win and there pass isn't 15 dollars. that's alot for a mobile game.,3,2025-11-13 05:49:42
"Clash Royale used to be fun — now it’s just *Cash Royale*. 💸 Unbalanced, pay-to-win, and devs who stopped listening. Supercell? More like *Moneysell*!

Games should live for players — not players for the game. 👎🔥",1,2025-12-19 15:38:08
"I don't even feel like trying to play because they have taken out all the beginner friendly stuff in the game for money spending grind. Even the ranked mode has you go in with level 15 troops. I loved the ranked mode for its beginner friendly nature. If you had under leveled cards in the higher ladder, you could go on ranked and try on some new decks before you spent money on leveling up other cards or grinding for cards you know will work. Just because of that, I guess I'm uninstalling. Sad.",1,2025-10-06 11:54:28
"it sucks that every new card that gets released just makes me want to quit, unbalanced and just too op, and this is the game where you need a high level set of cards to win, skills won't matter tbh, in my 3 years of playing it and staying positive, the game had always sucks, i just go back to play it every 3 months and quit because it's just straight up frustrating to play against an overleveled player",1,2025-09-04 18:36:39

"The game itself is very good and enjoyable, it entertained me and was engaging to grind and play against friends. One problem though is the amount of P2W elements in the game which generally ruin the potential of how fun the game could be. I even quit the game for a few weeks because of this problem. Clash Royal should also add a new feature each time you get into a new arena where all your cards get upgraded to a minimal level to reduce the amount of p2ws.",4,2025-12-04 13:20:34

the game is amazing and funny but the most trash thing about this game to be honest is that you should pay to have the most fun like really? I am tower of level 12 and u make me play with a tower level 13 and cards with level 14 ! how is that should be fair ? and that is the most part I hate about this game and each time I install it to have fun I then come back to delet it after playing this rounds with an opponent with higher towers and cards just because he paid to gain more upgrad and chests,2,2025-09-30 09:11:49
"back to three stars, this game used to be so great, everything was fine, sure maybe a bit of raging, but now I can't find entertainment, all the rounds I'm playing are usually against people who pay to win, and that's all the ""skill"" they need, they can spam any card they want already at lvl 15 when I'm barely lvl 10, please just make this more balanced, don't throw the community away with cheat p2w tactics",3,2025-09-03 21:48:48

And to specify, no, this was not because of an internet issue at least on my end. anyways the error made it impossible to win any matches and was incredibly frustrating.",1,2025-10-21 13:59:07

The game isn't very balanced and the limitation of 8 cards and having to focus on multiple counters for every card in the game is annoying and tedious it's not that some people are bad at the game but having to have a 7-4 elixir card just for it to be defeated by a 1-2 elixir is absurd and there's not enough counters for a lot of cards of the game and having less elixir is more rewarding than having more as cards above 4 elixir are practically not balanced,2,2025-11-09 09:39:47

The game is very gud and addictive but it is P2W game but it is not that big of a problem. People are complaining abt P2W thing bcuz they cannot win while being a F2P player. I am currently in Arena 16 and it only took me 1 yr. People r just bad and cannot win that is why they r giving the excuse of the being P2W. Yes at a limit it a P2W but it is not that bad of a game.

I grind If u don't it'll take longer to get higher. But it's certainly possible. Everyone who's frustrated has skill issue. 4 stars because it's just not perfect.

I lot my account and was trying to get it back , failed cause of this issue but weirdly enough brawlstars cares enough to look into things and gave me my account back. not to mention how P2W this game is. levels are everything and your not getting past level 11 without years of grinding, OR that sweet sweet 🤑🤑🤑 that clash cares so much about. still fun somehow",2,2025-09-03 22:32:53
peak genuinely an amazing and fun game though it gets a bit difficult as you get more trophies,5,2026-01-27 05:08:26
horribly set up to pay and win. will once higher levels it will consistently give you opponents that you cant beat. levels and multiple characters over my levels... definitely should beca game removed for basically trapping people to spend money,1,2025-10-18 19:40:23
"This game is intentionally designed to be unbalanced to encourage users to purchase loot boxes to potentially upgrade their cards. It's supposed to be a competitive game yet it's literally pay to win. Absolute trash, don't waste your time or money.",1,2025-09-13 00:26:40
This game is so good. I love it. I can play with my friends easily and can use it in my free time. MEGA KNIGHT,5,2026-02-11 04:31:38
"I've recently got back into the game after playing on and off for 9+ years to be reminded of the reason I dropped the game to begin with. It's a good concept fallen into the hands of the wrong people. The game is enjoyable in custom matches against friends but it's not designed for you to get to the top without spending any money. At some point, you will only face overleveled cards that result in an negative elixir trade, even if you defend perfectly. Sad to see a great game become P2W trash.",1,2025-09-15 14:41:23
"So my friends told me to try out this game, since it's all over the place. I already knew about it before, and I didn't know why it got popular all of a sudden. Played it for a good 4 days and deleted it. The game is unplayable. Every match you go up against players who spent their life savings and college fund to get the highest level troops possible. The game makes almost no sense, and its EXTREMELY non-beginner friendly. You have to know a lot about the game in order to actually enjoy it.",1,2025-09-27 23:10:18
"This game was fun at the start. It can have great gameplay. which is the main problem with this game. constant balance changes to cards, implementation of new ones, like the heroic cards, can make this game aggravating for free to play players. it is impossible to adapt to when the meta changes and constantly demoralizing. every new piece of content added only makes the game more exponentially expensive and frustrating to play as they remove more methods of rewarding the player. avoid this game.",1,2025-12-09 15:05:50
"I rated it 5 stars last time, but after getting people that counter my deck i just couldn't handle it. I was in a 5 row win streak and only need one win till the next arena, suddenly i just kept getting people that countery deck. I hope its just a bug but this just isnt ok Edit: Ok i was just reallyyyyyy overdramatic, I like the game again Edit: on second thought this deserves less than a 1.",1,2025-10-24 23:47:23
"Uninstalling it after Playing it for 2 years . As now it really irritate me . There is too many bugs and problems. Continuous connection lost retry , I have to start again and lost more than 500 trophies straight just because it get lost in the middle of game even my internet is super fast. I tried reinstalling it but didn't work . Even tried clearing cache . This app doesn't even provide customer support, only we can select those option which they want to listen. no option to give our opinions.",1,2024-04-12 18:04:21
This game is annoying and a waste of time. If you don't get the pass you will be spending your life on this game. Literally took me 3 years to get my deck to max. And even more annoying is the draft challenges. Do you really want to spend your time doing draft every season? This game doesn't have many game modes and will get boring quickly. They are starting to turn this game completely to pay to win. The 20 win challenge resets you if you lose 3 times! So skip this game and play anything else!,1,2024-06-24 12:29:23
"I had long time enjoyed this game... but now it is nonsense. The ""Mystery Boxes"" are a waste of time, despicable. The evolution concept seemed like a good idea in theory, but practically it is coming to a dull point; the Evolution should have been kept at a specific card tier. The time of this game becoming one of those in the memory seems to be nearing. Matchmaking is taking longer than before too.",2,2024-11-24 17:07:01
I think the game could be good but I think it has 10 clear issues in my opinion 1. Why is there timer for a game that takes about 5 min. 2. why us there a cooldown on characters j think how they could have done better is making it so the character that you used has a cool down but not everything else. 3. why do when you start or you when your just in the game go against someone who had for my experience I found myself at 59 trophy and the other person having 81 trophys I can't 10 1/10 star,1,2025-09-27 05:23:09
"I've been playing on n off for 6+years. As of now, the game has become pay to win. You need to spend an enormous amount for progression if you don't want to wait for months, just to upgrade a single card to max level. Also, the matchmaking seems more rigged recently, matching you up with counter decks if you win more than twice/thrice continuously. It's designed to make you spend money for progressing. Will be back when these issues are addressed. Until then, happy raging to the ones who stay!",1,2024-03-25 12:52:45
"Great game, extremely fun. The only problem is that it's pay to win. People who spend money on the game end up way higher level than you, and your cards in the end just won't cut it. The game says it's 'pay to progress' but you can't progress if you keep losing to people who have paid, and if you can't progress then you will never have a chance of beating them unless you pay.",4,2021-06-07 19:17:33
"The gameplay is fun, but the game is pay to win. The evolution cards are really powerful (should I say gamebreaking), and they are basically impossible to get unless you spend a lot of money (13.49$ for one full card). And that's just the tip of the iceberg, to level cards to level 15 it takes an insane amount of time unless *again* you spend 10$ to level one card. It's sad really...",1,2024-04-03 21:13:37

"I used to love this game! Not anymore! It seems like the only way to win is to pay! Your hard work used to mean something! Now it just doesn't even matter if you face someone who spends constant money on upgrades! On top of that, potions NEED to be removed! The ability to render your opponent defenseless is almost cheating! I've spent years playing this game and lose almost every time someone uses them against me! I guess playing fair isn't a thing anymore!",1,2024-06-26 21:47:35
"This game used to be great when it was simple. Even Mega Evolutions were fine. Now it's just like those spammy apps with annoying animations and color pop-ups. It's overwhelming and frustrating. If this continues, I'm sure in two years, no one will be playing. The OG players can clearly see how much it's gone downhill. Whoever is in charge of these awful animations (like the Mystery Box that forces extra clicks) should be fired. This is a waste of time and ruins the experience completely.",1,2024-10-09 06:43:54
"An excellent game. Easily one of the best games i ever played. But, it severely handicaps players who can't pay. Several hours and even days of waiting for only 1 chest to open. That's plain cruel. It's simply supercell saying ""If you got a ton of money to put into this game, good. But if not, then too bad, get stuck for months making the same progress that a paying player will make in three days."" And you can't even have more than four chests at a time not to mention you have to wait for hours to just unlock one chest and only one at a time! That's way too cruel. They need to limit the chest wait time to something like an hour and at the very, very least remove the "" only one chest can be opened at a time"" thing.",1,2018-12-16 15:01:35
"I've had to edit my review because the game is increasingly becoming unplayable with the lags. In the recent 20 match tilt quest, I played a match where I beat the other person (3 star) only to find out later that I was seeing a lie (a simulation if you will) and actually none of the moves I'd made (from 1:30 onwards) were even registered and the opponent beat me without me making a move. It's almost impressive that their simulation was so genuine, but that doesn't get me back my loss, does it?",2,2020-07-25 07:45:04
"I'm changing my review from a 5 star for two reasons. First, the game has always consumed a lot of data. (40 - 60MB upon opening the app) I have to use mobile data so as not to lag and lose trophies. Not worth it anymore. Second, I discovered I'm the only one who's having the problem. I engaged support only to be rudely brushed off and told to ONLY contact them if I had another query as they'd already responded(rudely). I've loved the game for years but I have no choice but to uninstall. Sad.",3,2020-01-06 11:37:57
"Aesthetic wise, this game is great. The controls are easy to understand as long as you check what each card does. The one problem I have is game balance: some cards, like hog rider and royal giant, are way too powerful. They're almost always going to get a hit or 2 off, and cost relatively little, so they can be supported easily. The game for some reason will also sometimes put you against people who completely counter your card deck, which is quite annoying.",3,2019-07-20 01:52:38
"Clash Royale was SO much fun for the 3 or 4 years I played it, was a great time killer, and the strategy of its real-time battles was very enjoyable. Sadly the most recent wave of updates (the most recent one in particular) has made it so that I find no reason to keep playing. The free to play friendly progression system has been done away with in favor of making the players have to buy their way forward and enough is enough. Deleting the game and most likely never looking back. Hehehaha. 💔",1,2025-04-21 12:54:07
"Its fun at first. But very soon after, it caps. And making progress is not possible without spending a lot of real money on gold. Or spending hours reading and watching strategy videos and articles. If you are looking to delve deep into a game and spend time and money, this game is for you. If you are looking for a game to just mess around with without going hard core, you way want to look elsewhere.",3,2022-06-28 10:38:03
"I really wanted to like this game, but the constant connectivity issues make it incredibly frustrating to play. I frequently experience lag spikes that disrupt gameplay, making even simple actions feel delayed. On top of that, there are frequent disconnects during matches causing me to lose or, worse, get kicked out of the game entirely. This has happened multiple times, and it severely impacts the enjoyment and immersion of the game. It’s really disappointing !!",1,2024-12-01 01:26:01
"While it can be a fun, competitive game, the lack of true content updates can make the game seem stale after awhile. New cards and new game modes can be nice, but its basically the same game since launch. A problem with the game balance, is that the game seems centered around dealing as much splash damage as possible, and the cards that do this are extremely durable, namely the valkyrie.",3,2020-06-06 07:47:29
"At the beginning is fun, it's fine, but when you go further 4k the game becomes p2w, and the matchmaking is terrible, it matches you against opponents with a great level advantage, and if you want to play with the same level card you go to the challenges, but everyone uses pretty much the same cards so it's boring after a while... Long story short... Don't waste your time in this game, you can find better multi-player games",1,2020-08-20 06:23:50
"Honestly really like this game, so it can have 2 stars. The cards are cool and its a nice strategy. Now for the long list of cons, first and most important. This game is pay to win to an extreme degree. If you don't pay, you won't get too far. Second is the fact that you never know or can choose what decks players against you have, meaning you could go into a game with someone who completely counters anything you have, and the ranked system is terrible. This is a short list of the cons.",2,2022-04-27 08:01:09
"I started playing this game when it first came out and it was awesome!! Simple, play the game, get a chest and wait, you actually had to work to get cards and legendary cards were the best and crazy if you got even one! Now, I've gotten a free legendary at least twice a week for the past few months. And everything is so pay to win nowadays and all of the evolutions have completely ruined the skill factor of this game. My favorite deck (logbait) is completely unplayable now.",1,2024-09-18 23:06:46
"I have played since launch. It was a great game then, and over the next few years of the games life, it had improved. The first season pass was $4.99 and that was a reasonable price for the amount of items you received. Now it's $11.99!?!? The screen is littered with in-app purchases. If you want to reach your free rewards, you need to first scroll past at least 10 different micro transactions that range from $1.99-24.99. I miss the original game. The game is now a cash grab :(",1,2024-11-18 03:47:43
"Used to be my go to game. Even got my wife playing it with me. After the Clan Wars 2 update it has become extremely boring and monotonous. Do whatever you can to not become level 13 cause immediately after that you will only play 13s that seem to always have a max deck. You will not be able to experiment with other cards, if you want to win. I quit buying the battle pass cause it seemed to speed up progression but it doesn't matter if your only progressing into a brick wall.",1,2020-11-23 00:43:01
"The game has become so ""pay 2 win"" it's ridiculous. I used to really enjoy the game. After coming back to the game after leaving for a few years I got matches that I won fairly easily. Then got to challenger 1 and kept facing level 11's w maxed cards. Event challenges are a joke. EVERY time I win 2-3 matches in a row and then get 3 losses in a row. Magic items are just more p2w. And makes it harder to unlock new legendaries. 3* bc as long as you not trophy pushing you can still have fun",3,2021-06-01 01:40:57
"The game is pretty good, but I won't give it five stars, for I have one problem. When I play 2v2 almost 1/5 of matches I play with an AFK. The problem here is that there's no balancing the game where's there an AFK or someone Dcs. I know that this isn't a big problem, because the game is focused on 1v1, but one such thing happens to me I just wanna stop playing it. It would be great when there was a mechanic where AFKs where disconnected automatically and the remaining player would receive elixir x2, or reporting system. Anyways the game's very good and keep up the good work! :)",4,2018-09-23 03:36:25
"I've noticed with more and more updates, the game lags a bit, which isn't bad, but glitches a whole lot more now. The game is getting worse and worse with freezing and glitching. Either on my brand new phone or my tablet. Whether it is true glitches or hackers, the game needs some serious help i think after 4 years or is about time to quit. Can no longer okay competitively when 3 out of 5 matches glitch for the loss.",1,2021-02-27 00:00:34
"Like many other players I've been around since the beta testing. Such a well-thought, deftly made game. However, I do have one concern. And one that many of my friends, who have also been playing the game for 3 years, can confirm. It seems as if you are doing good and win consecutive matches, the game will automatically queue you up against DIRECT counters on your deck and set you up for a very frustrating losing streak. If you download this game, prepare to be frustrated 40% of the time.",3,2019-07-14 20:17:40
"The game is good as such strategy gaming but the level we end up playing seems quite fake as we go deeper, you are lured into the game, when you reach a certain level and you feel you are playing good but it's fake... Please don't get too deep into the game. Its my experience at certain level if you keep playing you'll get to know, you will start losing and loss continues even when, how good a player plays at level 7 around 3000 trophies, I came down by more than 300 trophies while playing continuously, so it seemed that I was not good player at level 7 to keep up the 3100 trophies. Playwell :) have a nice time ;)",2,2018-10-23 03:42:09
"The game has become too repetitive. After about 5200 trophies you begin seeing players that all use the same deck of cards with slight changes. At first it didn't upset me, I understand that it's a choice to copy and play play with someone else's deck. But my problem with it is, that is the ONLY thing I see in this game now. There are 99 DIFFERENT cards that each do they're own thing. But instead everyone chooses to play the same thing because it's considered ""good"". I enjoy the game. Rarely.",2,2020-09-04 08:41:43
First off asking for a review after every battle is really annoying. Seconded even when you're lucky enough to get a really good card it benefits you nothing because it's so easy to kill at level1 and they are so rare you'll likely never get 2. You have to spend hours trying to get enough cards and gold to level anything up. Still sucks. Update 2. Often hate this game. Don't want to have to grind foreeeeeever to complete gold rush or events. Want to play than be done!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1,2023-07-28 22:44:33
"It's a fun and engaging game, but this is the third and final time I uninstall it. The matching algorithm is completely unfair. If you want to consistently be matched against players who are 2-3 levels higher than you in every match, then this is the game for you. If you consistently want to play impossible to win matches against level 13 maxed out troops as a level 9, then this is the game for you. I've spent $100's over the last 3 years and I'm finally done. Good luck to you all!",1,2019-10-08 07:20:24
"""Great game if you if you like teamwork, strategy and dragons"" I wrote that review in 2017 alongside a 5 star rating. The game is now more pay-to-win then ever with the addition of the lvl 14 update. It no longer takes skill to get new cards, it now takes time and/or money, and lots of it. The game isn't much fun without friends to play it with in my opinion because it feels less like a game and more like a chore. Champions can be unlocked at lvl 14, which isn't something you can get by playing",2,2021-10-27 18:21:36
"Nice game. I have been playing it for about 4 or 5 years now and I have to say, its a great game. It can get really addictive when you start playing. But there is a problem where you fight opponents at a higher or lower arena than you. But it is a good game. Sometimes its a pay to win. The challenges and clan wars are really fun. The chest take too long to open and sometimes it gets too hard to find a legendary card. Would definitely recommend. (Also I rate it 4.5 stars not 4!)",4,2021-07-29 09:44:29
"Came back to the game after a few years and they absolutely ruined it. The pay to win is on another level now. I reached a point where it is impossible to win a single game (no matter which gamemode I play on) because I get thrown into matches with higher-level enemies AND enemies with evolutions (broken cards). The only way I can compete against this atrocity is to pay $$$, get evolutions, and max all my cards out. And one other thing, the monetization is shoved down your throat. It's over...",1,2024-07-28 10:21:59
"Clash royale is a fun, tower defense like game. You do not have to spend money to win in this game. I was able to obtain legendaries, cards, and push trophies without spending much money.

Edit: Supercell, you are an absolute disappointment. It is incredible how fast greed can corrupt and destroy everything.

"Matchmaking is custom designed to screw you if you don't pay cash to level up. Troop levels aren't taken into account during matching, so youre constantly running into people who max leveled their troops, giving them a massive advantage over everyone else. It's very hard to max level a single unit without paying, much less all of them, so f2p players are at a massive disadvantage. Not so bad at first, but gets VERY bad later on, to the point that its almost unplayable if you advance too quickly.",1,2021-10-10 05:27:47

I hope you guys put in the effort to fix these bugs.",2,2019-08-01 22:21:35
"The game is fun to play both alone and with friends. Strategy and skill (prediction and timing) are on the same level, and that's why the game is competitive. Each game lasts max 6 minutes and that makes it so easy to just play one game and then stop if you are busy. The only (huge) cons is that either you pay with real money or you have to dedicate your entire life, for months, in order to get to a decent (competitive) level.

"Worst balance I've seen! The tournament fight is a really interesting idea, but I've never seen such an unfair gameplay! I'm lvl 9 and I usually don't pay for mobile games and I'm playing against lvl 10 players, who have nearly every card you could imagine. I couldnt even attack a single tower and lost 4 times in a row! So, if you want to play a game truly unfair, this is the right for you!",1,2018-12-25 16:56:14
This game is fun. It's a good time killer. However I would like to point out is the balance in this game is very bad. The random player search could really use an overhaul as there is too much level difference giving advantage in most cases. Even if there were longer wait times to get the correct matchup I would be happier personally. I'm sure that it wouldn't take that much to balance this game. All in all I have a lot of fun playing but there are times that I have no urge to play due to these issues. I'll change my opinion and rating as I see changes.,2,2021-08-30 05:59:54
"One of my most favorite games. I love the animations for legendaries. I love the chest cycles and the awesome 2v2 button. You guys should advertise stats royale, but not a lot. That was me three years ago. Now I think the game is more fun for the people who actually want to spend money on the game. I have been playing for a while. Now, they added pass royale, making it 5 dollars, and it really made me mad. I'm not the only one who thinks this though. Pay to Win. But it is still a good game.",3,2019-09-30 22:55:46
"Glitches everywhere! For the past month and even worse with the recent update, the app closes out as soon I am matched in 1v1 or 2v2. And if it doesn't close out, it lags causing me to finally enter into a match already in progress. I messaged and they told me it is my connection. If it is was my connection, other devices would not be working properly during these so-called ""connectivity"" issues. I am unsure if it is just glitches in the game or their servers being uncapable to keep up. Fix it!",1,2019-10-13 07:58:59
Honestly I grinded this game all the way up to 3400 trophies after that it was a living hell. you lose WAY to much trophies when you lose and all the pay to wins just have legendary cards at line arena 7. I thought this game was good at first but it kinds sucks.,2,2025-09-06 02:17:44

Just reinstalled to check this out after my 2021 review and somehow it's gotten worse. Wow. Uninstalling again. Install this only if you want to spend a ton of time and energy and money to be remotely competitive.

"A game that is a deck building, troop placement strategy game. It's a pay to win game, and free to play players will be very much at a disadvantage. It takes time to figure out what troops counter others, and that's what game knowledge and skill is needed. After playing for years I'm uninstalling for good. It's worth while if you want to put hundreds of dollars and countless hours into it. Displeased that it's how it is, the strategy parts is what kept it enjoyable for so long.",2,2019-05-03 17:04:13
"The concept is good, but the game itself is terrible. For starters it is one of the most unbalanced games out there. One day a certain card is broken and the other it is useless. (Although there are some cards that are consistently annoying like elite barbarians and mega knight). Secondly, it is pay to win. People willing to spend money are going to get a big advantage (it's worth noting that no content is kept behind pay walls). It only gets props for the creative game modes and the rare fun.",2,2021-11-09 01:18:42
"Not having a simple report system is frustrating. So many ways to make things harder or even boring for others and the game does not seem to focus on these issues.

Thanks for the time spent =)",2,2023-04-20 02:21:06
"Briefly fun, built for frustration. I won't get into the pay to win aspects of this game since that is common on mobile. The real issue is the matchmaking is explicitly built to slow your progress. If you're doing well and having fun they match you against an opponent built to beat you. Early on this happens less but don't waste your time. Eventually this game will be more frustrating than fun.",1,2020-02-20 20:35:55
"After a 5 year break, I decided to try the game again. No surprise......game concept is still amazing but you guys just cant get the game play equal. It is more than frustrating and who the hell wants to play a game where you pretty much lose 90% of the time. I am a lv 12, playing lv 11 opponents with maxed cards. This was my last try.

"Honestly, I used to love this game but recently its been rigged. I used to win every once in a while but now I loose every game and everyone I play against is leveled at least 2 levels higher than me. I loose every game and it's just getting annoying, even after switching up the deck... Hopefully something changes for me! Just jumped back on after not playing for a while even 400 trophies down I'm still loosing and playing crazy leveled up people. Might delete the game again.",2,2018-11-28 13:09:52

You get bombarded with ingame purchase offers, the gameplay is stale, it lacks innovation - the introduction of lvl 15 was the last straw, I think that the game is dying unless Supercell reverts the damage, that they've done. But currently I have no reason to believe that they will do so, they're too stubborn about it and will run the game into the ground. What a shame, it used to be an enjoyable game.",1,2023-06-19 19:58:55
"The game play is fundamentally great. So simple to understand yet so many layers of interactions, timing and transactions makes the game play very fun and makes you feel very skillful. However, progression is a slog (it took me 2 years to get to max), updates are very infrequent and underwhelming at best and there really is only 1 way of playing the game. I deleted my supercell account along with 4 years of experience and its been awesome.",3,2021-05-08 04:32:17
"The game at first was great. I have played it for 6 years. Until the continuous updates, unnecessary characters and excessive cash payments. Once you don't have money for a card upgrade , you will LOSE a Battle and trophies. Another issue the game has is this buggy feature during Clan Wars. You attack an enemy boat and their health bar for the cannons are still intact. Overall, the game used to be great, but NEWER ISN'T ALWAYS BETTER.",1,2025-04-22 05:15:17
"This is a good game... If you have fast internet. The game itself can be played with slow internet but the problem comes when you load into a match. You see the game doesn't check if it's loaded for you before starting the match like games such as League do. Instead it just starts it and if your game takes a bit longer to load than your opponent's, they immediately have a major advantage.",3,2018-12-06 05:02:35
"Came back to the game after a year or so off only to find the micro transactions are worse. Every screen has a call to action. Elite wildcards, diamond pass, gold pass, 3-4 shop offers, events, etc. It used to be a fun game and the only reason I left in the first place was because of IRL events. Now it has become your typical mobile game. Sorry Supercell this is not for me.",2,2023-06-29 19:52:40
"The new vault mode in clan wars is one of the most idiotic, stupid, and uncreative things your team has done in a very very long time. Aside from that, the classic war deck mode is unfair, often giving one player cards that do not counter the other player's deck. If you can fix this, I'll change it to 5. After two years, I still wish there was an option to give zero stars.",1,2019-06-13 22:13:12
"EDIT: The addition of the pass has made this a completely subscription-based game. Realistically, you don't pay-to-win anymore... you pay-to-play. Non-sub players are at such a disadvantage it is basically not optional. While it seems possible to remain competitive without paying money, the reality is that you will always be behind anyone who does. This is because of the mechanic by which you can buy the cards themselves rather than opening the chests.",1,2019-07-03 18:12:33
"This game is really great. I've been playing since the game game out. Back when clans costed gems to make and when Legendary cards weren't a thing. I'm running a successful clan that wins wars almost every time and I am passionate about this game. However, the recent update as majorly impacted the experience of playing Clash royale. A lot of people I know can not access Clash aroyale anymore and every time I go to initiate a battle, the loading screen takes about 15 seconds which is drastically impacting my gameplay as enemies are taking out my towers before I even actually enter the game. Another issue that is really intoxicating for everyone is the new trading system. A lot of people are complaining stating that its ""a MonEY GraB"" and so on. My clan is filled with over 30 trade requests because trades have become so complicated and poor now. This was a really good game but I am afraid it will plummet into failure if you do not reverse the changes or recreate them in a way that suits everyone. If you read this, thank you for your time. This is a really good game but has had a devestating update.",2,2018-12-16 07:32:44
"Clash Royale is a very sloppy designed game, with very lackluster created characters, and very few updates, and when there is one, it always seems to be filler and doesnt actually produce anything productive for the well being of the game. While there are some times where Clash is kind of enjoyable, however, those moments are vastly overshadowed by the extent of said lackluster characters and very, very, VERY poor game design. I would never recommend it to my worst enemy in a million years.",1,2020-02-16 00:43:30
"Very pay to win, but it can still be kind of fun. Edit: It was 3 stars, but it's now so P2W that I can't progress at all. I'm not a bad player, I do decent in challenges. But I don't have the money to sink into all the evolutions. To be able to play multiple decks. Dagger duchess is what pushed me over the line. There are no more wild cards in the season shop, so unless you want to spend money enough, losing 1/2 the games because your tower troops are under levelled.",1,2024-04-21 03:42:27
"The game is great on a technical basis. There are very few bugs, the large variety of cards function as they are described, and there are several interesting battlemodes. But with all fun aspects of gameplay considered, some of the out-of-gameplay core mechanics are just fun killers. Since cards and towers are leveled, if someone has cards many levels higher than yours in a fight, they have a significant advantage. So, either you buy more cards with real cash, or painstakingly collect them. 👎",3,2019-10-21 06:22:49
"This has become a pay to win game. Subscription for bonus chests and other benefits. If you don't spend money, you will have a hard time winning. Edit : I decided to try the game again. After playing for a week, good internet connection, i am placing cards and the game is waiting 3 or 4 seconds before placing the cards after i tried placing them. Impossible to win any matches like this.",1,2021-07-06 01:39:19
"Used to be a good game, but has quickly went downhill. It's extremely pay to win. The new cards are extremely overpowered and it takes WAY too long to upgrade one card to max. For example, I've been a free to play player for about 6 years and don't even have one card at max level yet, but someone can easily upgrade all their cards if they are willing to spend some money. Very unfair matchmaking too. It puts you up against players who are 3 or 4 levels higher than you.",1,2024-09-26 06:26:48
"This game was fun. WAS. But this new update completely taints my opinion of the game and shows what it really is about. Yes, the pass royale is pointless and was horribly implemented, but the fact that the game is becoming less and less playable as it goes on speaks volumes to Supercell's intentions. Patching a few of the sometimes years old bugs isn't enough. I have spent money on this game, got to 4K, but this game has become a money grubbing unplayable mess. Good riddance.",1,2019-07-10 08:03:15
"high reviews for this money grab game is either from those prepared to spend significant sums of money or those new to the game. Thought I'd update again after the introduction of the level 15 cards and evolution cards. Again as has been each update, it's just another money grab. They've boosted a set of cards that are impossibly difficult to upgrade unless you pay £5.99 each... These cards are boosted to such a degree you're pretty much going to lose if you don't have one and the opponent does!",1,2023-09-28 15:20:24
"Played for 8 years. They decided to make the game a fully pay to win game. Nearly no progress can be made if you were maxed level 14 when the evolutions came out. Been using the same deck for years, so has many people. Now everyone is forced to find a deck, hope that it stays relevant by the time you get the evolutions or level 15. Game used to be fun, challenging, easy to pick up at any point without feeling like you're playing a new game. Loved the game, until money became the main priority.",3,2024-02-21 18:30:49
"Editing my review from 4 years ago... The matching system SUCKS! I get either players too tough or they're able to bring out 3-4 characters at a time but yet, I have some of the same and it won't let me go that fast. What gives? Definitely set up pay to win! Could be fun if you stood a chance but you can't keep up and then have a time for them to go yet they take most your life before forming? Yeah no, I'm through with this! Long time player no more!",2,2020-07-24 06:36:17
"WORST UPDATE EVER!!!! I've played this game for about 4 years, was always a great time killer and was interesting. Since the last update, battle matches are unfair and the chances of winning a match are ridiculously low. It's made the game boring. I have pretty high level cards but I can't even fill my chest slots since the update. I've bought the battle passes each time, but I won't be spending any more money if things aren't fixed.... I'll be uninstalling instead, which is a massive shame 😔",2,2019-10-03 16:15:33
"I love this game so much, and I would rate it 5 stars in a heartbeat, but I have encountered a major flaw. My phone isnt that great, so at the beginning of a game it can take up to 30 seconds to load into the match. In those 30 seconds, I've usually lost a tower or even gotten 3 crowned. It makes it impossible to climb, impossible to participate in clan wars and impossible to participate in events and challenges. Please just add a feature where the game doesnt start until ALL players are loaded.",2,2019-05-18 22:22:20
"EDIT - Game is still fun to play, is still dynamic, is still strategic. But the company has shown time and time again a disconnect from players. Clan war refactor was atrocious, and even if they took some steps to correct it, I still think it shows a stubbornness to stir back at unpopular changes, and the new upcoming addition of a new card/tower level that adds nothing other than just grind, and the dishonesty of announcing it after an event that nudged players at spending gold is a bad omen.",2,2021-11-16 19:57:52
"it's a fun game I do enjoy it, the only thing I don't enjoy is the game says it matches you with an equal opponent's trophy count, but the algorithm to me is similar to a slot machine. It allows you to win by not comparing the experience but just the trophy count, (which is how they get away with it), but the games ultimate intentions is all for the money, so the more you play the more you lose so that you can spend money on the game to increase your chance of winning. The match making is a lie.",1,2019-05-13 08:51:39
"I think its a pretty good game, but when the game updates and I realized when I saw other reviews I went to the options menu and clicked 'From this device model only' for the reviews and it seems the game only works for Apple products, and me having an Android the game just crashes and won't let me play. So if you could fix it so it would work for androids too I would appreciate it. Overall Great game",3,2019-07-21 21:31:25
"It is just a pay and play game. You can play for free for the initial level. But after certain level,you'll not get enough cards to level up untill you pay up. The match making also is very illogical. Also the server get disconnect a lot of time in between games. Especially when you play a limited entry matches. Pathetic.",1,2020-05-12 09:37:38
"You guys need to fix the new setup. I'm a level 11 and I'm always playing level 13 players with higher level cards. I can only get so far. Players are purposely losing to collect better rewards when the season restarts. In doing this, I get to play people who have no business playing at my level. If you think I'm going to spend money (which could be the idea on why you allow it) to help level up my cards, you're out of your mind.",1,2019-10-01 03:00:45
"The gameplay, graphics, and mechanics are awesome. There are several issues... In battles you will usually face decks that are clearly superior unless you get VERY lucky and get two or three good rare cards. Also, the chest times and limitations are ridiculously high opening one chest every three to twelve hours, and most of the upgrade cost past level four is so expensive, you'll be playing for weeks to upgrade even common cards... Clans cost way too much money to create. VERY disappointing.",3,2019-09-09 01:59:37
"Game takes way to long to be able to upgrade your cards. It always matches you up in unfavorable matches. Also, there is sometimes a lag at the beginning of the game that lets the other player get a head start on you and by the time the lag is over its pretty much to late and you lost. Other than that its a fun game that lets you pass time.",2,2021-03-31 18:12:13
"It's gotten pretty bad lately. Been playing since day 1, but I'm considering ending it here. Update: I took about a year break and came back and it was even worse. The game is riddled with constant ""new"" additions and updates that overcomplicate the game. The evolutions keep getting added to more and more cards making it honestly less and less fun. It's to the point where anyone new has to pay to play to keep up. I've been here since the beginning and I feel like I need to pay to play tbh.",1,2024-03-18 18:10:26
"Wow... I used to adore this game, up until the point where Supercell became gluttonous for money over the satisfaction of their player base. Another issue is the ridiculous match ups and the fact that my connection is lost at random times, resulting in me losing hundreds of trophies. And yes, I do have a strong, stable WiFi connection. If you wanna stay happy, stay away from Clash Royale.",1,2020-09-12 06:51:16
"I've been playing the game for like 6 years now. It use to be my favorite game to play, but here lately (actually for a little while now) it just seems to be going in the wrong direction. It's become less enjoyable to play over the last several updates. I think it's unbalanced and has several unnecessary parts. There are like two ladders now. This last update has really made less enjoyable.",2,2022-11-14 17:53:11
"I play very casually, usually coming back for a couple weeks every year before I stop again. I'm still disappointed by the lack of variety in the ranked game modes. Everyone is running the same/similar decks. This game has so much potential, but the lack of *REQUIRED* balance updates usually means running into the same types of decks against Enemies with the same play style. There's unfortunately no variety and as a result very little fun for casual free to play gamers.",1,2023-06-14 15:26:24
My review still has not changed. Fix your game.. The way they set you up should be by level not trophies. that way it's more of a fair fight and you don't get screwed over by some one with a level 6 vs a level 3. The chest should have shorter timers then they have now. It shows that it is a pay to win. What made clash of clans fun was it was not a pay to win game. Guys step your game up for me to give you more stars.,1,2021-06-26 02:41:39
"I have played this have for a few years. It has increasingly become loaded with all sorts of ads and purchases which I can handle to an extent. But now the gameplay is affected with the evolution cards. If you don't pay for all of the add-ons and packages, it is harder to compete on the same level. Good for them for making money, but it sure makes the game less fun. Unfortunately I am uninstalling this game now. I guess it will free up some wasted time.",2,2024-12-03 09:11:04
"I'm getting game lags and slow connectivity always when i open clash Royale which was not fixed still even after a year. It's not fun anymore. And another thing is that i often get low connection icon although my internet speed is super which often lead to loss. I'm starting to wonder if there's a crack game that messes with the actual game, to also note that it's happening over and over. I'm in love with the game but this right now is a heart break. I hope they really take care of their game.",1,2021-01-12 19:07:53
"Clash Royale is, and has alwaye been, a fun game to compete with other players or just pass time. I have played this game for 3 years now and I still find it fun. The main reasons I rated the game 4 stars rather than 5 are that at high levels progression becomes incredibly slow unless you pay. Obviously it makes sense that progression slows down, but in this case it is way worse than it should be. The other reason it lost a star is because the new matchmaking system is ridiculous.",4,2019-07-07 01:39:56
"It's become a pay-to-win game. I played it since it started and I really enjoyed it until the pass appeared. Now that I see a player using a different tower skin, I know this player will probably have better cards than me. I don't plan to spend money on a mobile game; I've done it before and I found it a total waste. Please try to match players according to their ""paying status"", so things are fair again.",2,2020-06-22 21:15:30
"Great game, though the developers have focused too much on more bells and whistles to get your $$ more than improving game play. I'd say 75 percent of the time you get paired against a direct counter for your cards making skill meaningless. I miss the royal of old. They should have left well enough alone but I guess that doesn't make you rich. :( From 5 star to 3 New update as of 3/31/22 is too much. QUIT ADDING BS! It's getting too convoluted. It's overwhelming",3,2022-04-01 12:08:16
"Used to be one of the best mobile games, but for the past few years the game has become so pay-to-win, if not at the very least money-oriented, that even the whales have a hard time catching up. It's no longer about the cards or the gameplay, but on how much higher we can make the upgrade levels and costs to the point where any skill-based matchups get nullified. Anything that made the progression easier and simpler has now been removed or nerfed heavily. This game doesn't respect your time.",1,2023-06-19 23:02:33
"Mobile games like this only solidify the fact the PC and console gaming will always win out...this whole greed thing the world has fallen into is crazy...get ahead by spending real money on a bit of coding?! Lol you have to be kidding me I don't mind spending $50-$60 on a full game with plot and loot, etc, but I wouldn't spend a dime to get a digital card and if you don't you don't move up easier to loose trophies than gain and again unless you buy you never see the higher arenas or the characters that come with them. So yeah...there's my bit",1,2018-12-15 13:07:04
"Game play is cool, but dropping players trophies doesn't make any . What's the point of earning them when you're going to take them and drop them a level? I've earned a lot of the cards playing on different levels, so you can't use that argument. Moreover, you shouldn't loose trophies when you have glitches & connection issues. The developers should've thought about that since it's a live action game. What if players are in the middle of a battle and some where down the line poor reception causes",2,2019-03-05 12:46:55
"It makes me sad to see yet another game consumed by supercell's love for money. As if in app purchases weren't enough, adding the ""battle pass"" or whatever allows people to significantly further there process in the game with card upgrades and resources than people who don't pay. Now, you see level 10's with Max level cards and the entire leveling system on its own means absolutely nothing. I used to love this game but now it just sucks, like really really sucks. Save your time and money!!",1,2019-10-17 21:52:57
"I had a bit of fun, trying to catch up to and best friends, challenging myself to see how far I could get without spending money. The answer was two level 14s (max at time), which took a year and a half, and 5600 on ladder. They'd been making improvements, extra daily rewards, and it was possible to get the later card thresholds with books of cards and chests from the free battle pass. Then they scrapped the books and free battle pass. Good luck not paying, I'm out.",1,2023-05-28 10:02:24
"Those saying it's a money grab lack skill,patience and understanding. Been playing sense the release, got frustrated several times. Then I realized some people are just better than me.

Learn to realize , good things come in time.",4,2021-10-28 00:35:37

I'm dropping down my rating to three stars due to the game becoming more a pay to play game. It is very easy for a lower-level player to buy a lot of stuff and become so darn good at the game because your troops are higher level then people that are two levels higher than you. This is extremely infuriating when I'm someone who's put a lot of time in this game and then run into someone who's a level 11 and I'm a level 13 and have level 13 troops whereas he has level 14 troops. :(,3,2023-08-16 07:14:56

I think we should have the option to choose a deck we want to go up against in the training mode. I put decks together to counter others and I use training to rehearse and anticipate what I go up against. The AI in training right now doesn't help much and the least we can do is put decks together that we normally see in a battle. Decks are stronger now with these new upgrades to the point where it is a bit unfair at times. Hopefully your team looks at this & consider this as an option.,3,2022-07-08 21:04:18

"As somone who's played this game since it came out, I have to say I'm very disappointed in what it's become. It was always a pay to win game, but it could be played with friends and you made it fun. Unfortunately the matchmaking still sucks. I wouldn't give it 2 stars for just that tho. I tried logging into my supercell id and it didn't let me.

"Game used to be fun, but it way to much diverse in the number of cards in the game. One minute, you destroy your opponent, the next you're in a good battle, then you go on a 7 game losing streak of just getting hard counted out of your mind and unless you have spent tons of money on the game to get more card and change your deck you get stuck partially at higher level arenas. The game is very skill based, which is great, but sometimes it literally doesn't matter how good you are you just loss.",1,2024-03-27 00:11:03
Editing my review from 2016 to one star. I've been playing this game since it launched. It had been the one game I put money into each month. And was happy to do so. Now they have doubled the monthly price for the game pass and made some curious gameplay features. I completely understand that an established game needs to attract new players but not at the expense of long time existing ones. I was a play every day kind of user. Most days was logging in multiple times as well. Not now...,1,2023-04-24 17:54:47
"THIS GAME IS EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE. IT COSTS THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO PLAY PROPERLY. I keep losing to people blatantly because they paid money. I'm only in the middle of the progression system. It will only get worse as I go. Apparently now they're adding a new level that either costs thousands of dollars, or takes literal years of constant gameplay to unlock. I don't want to waste money on a phone game. I play better games on my PC all the time. This is a fun game to play when I poop, at least.",1,2023-06-20 02:28:58
It's a fun game that I have been enjoying longer than any other mobile game. I especially like that the games are quick so I can play a quick match whenever. Deck building is great. I don't like the move to a season pass it makes it feel even more pay to win than it did before. At 5 bucks a month it's just more than I am willing to pay. But I have a lot of clan members that like it and continue to pay for it so I guess the price works for some people.,3,2019-08-02 01:01:56
"I've been a player and supporter of this game since it's beginning. The changes over the years have been pretty predictable. Increasing the card level cap, adjusting the in game economy and such. It was fair and made sense most of the time. Multiple game modes were added to get Chests. Chests are the main avenue of progress. This latest update has taken away the multiple options that were available to players to progress and funneled everyone into the ""Trophy Road"". 500 characters isn't enou",1,2023-04-05 18:01:09
"A game that keeps on giving. I've played this for years. I rate 4 stars, as I do think the game was better at first. Most updates and new cards seem to have changed the game to worse. Also every time a new card is made, it is over powered. I suppose this makes everyone want to own the card and spend money to level it up. Then after a year or so it is nerfed to balance. I love the game anyway!",4,2020-11-24 05:38:20
"This went from good to very bad. I would not recommend putting money into it if you actually want an edge in the game. It almost seems fun until you play for a few weeks. Its very unbalanced and you will see the same cards being used by everyone and if you don't have them, you're screwed. Had to uninstall to make space to make my phone run just that much faster and I still get adds for it. No! Never again!",1,2020-04-28 01:14:48
"I played this game when it first came out years ago and I recently picked it back up. I can't, I just can't. It's 100% pay-to-win, does very unbalanced opponent matching, and is full of noticable cheater/hacker. Not to mention, in the past 5 years, they have hardly added new content and what little content they have added is just completely unbalanced with the rest of the game. Would NOT recommend this game unless you want to spend money for a bunch of nonsense to make yourself better. 🚫",1,2021-03-03 21:01:30
"When clash Royale came out, it was a fun and unique game. You choose very carefully what you would upgrade and what strategy to play. It was very balanced and when you lost it felt like you legitimately got outplayed. All of that is gone. The game has genuinely become pay to win. They will add new content that takes several months to unlock while playing free. And by the time you finally unlock it, it will be nerfed. This game is not fun anymore, do not download it. It will only waste your time.",1,2024-06-24 09:12:08
"Game is very unbalanced. You can pay to get gold and cards to level up quickly. Otherwise the game is extremely grindy. It will take you well over a year and a half to get to max level. On top of that, those who pay can upgrade their cards faster, giving an unfair advantage on the field. The challenges are barely worth trying since they're dominated by players with very high level cards and towers. An OKAY game at best.",2,2019-01-02 12:35:25
"I thought overall well the idea was good. Just with the awesome cards and the different strategies makes this a fine game. Mechanically, this game really ruined it for me there was no like incentive for me for playing long periods of time in the day just like 30-45 minutes every 4 hours. I understand like earning money is important, but if you can't even delete a chest this game really doesn't seem on that interesting. Other then getting stars to rank up, but even then not very rewarding.",4,2021-09-27 14:50:51
"It was all good about a year ago, but now every time i open clash royale , first match will be delayed upto 1 minute and i will be lost. It takes a lot of time to open every day's first match. I got my new bluetooth headphones and when i connect it, it is strucking with audio and more disturbances are coming. It is normal when i play without headphones. I thought it is headphones fault and i tried to listen songs on youtube without disconnecting them, it was excellent and same repeats again...",1,2019-10-10 22:16:16
"It's becoming more and more of a pay to win game. There's quite little you can do to progress, especially at the higher leagues, but then there are players who buy a royal pass and bam! They'd progress with the speed of light. There is an exponential difference in opportunities between those who pay and those who don't. It is now frustratingly difficult to keep on playing without paying. The only reason I gave it 2 instead of 1 star is that i' ve been playing this game from before it was p2w.",2,2019-07-09 15:16:37
"The game can be fun however the game allows you to start a battle and then will not let you actually play anything stating that your wifi is bad even though it is five bars. While it is not allowing you to play, you can see every move your opponent makes as the game gives them a free win. Makes no sense! If it really cannot detect your wifi during a game it should not allow you to find one in the first place.",2,2020-11-26 03:16:04
"Fun game to play, not too many updates but when there are it's just new characters and such. Not much maintenance patches. No lag, not really, gameplay is simple. Update since 05/2018 The new boat clan war is lame the first day it came out. Lots of people already knew it would kill the game, and it has. Besides that, game is the same. Matchmaking is off sometimes. I'm maxed out and play against lvl 10s in war or so. Makes no sense. No interest in this game anymore",3,2020-11-19 03:11:45
"Been playing since before global launch. This game used to be great now it's almost unplayable. Ever since the war update, I've only been matched with lvl 13s with all max decks, and they're always over 1000 trophies higher than me. It's pointless to even try with my level 11s. They don't balance cards well so let's add new cards instead of fixing a very broken game. If I hadn't spent so much time in the game is uninstall. Don't download, you'll be better off.",1,2020-10-07 12:50:50
"Match ups can be a little one sided. But a good simple to play game. ^^^ Initial review^^^ Since then ... Frustrated with constant ""Balancing"" of cards by the manufacturers ... The way I see it ... you focus on building the strengths of the cards you like to use based on a certain deck strategy ... then all of a sudden ... a card you have worked to build up gets a review (Witch😢) ... and no longer has the impact or works in with your strategy ... now trying to find a new strategy ...",3,2019-11-18 20:26:57
Clash Royale does a great job of staying engaging at all levels of play with its MMR system. It's a good strategy card game and has a reasonable way to reach end game content without getting boring. My main problem with the game is an extremely weak clan system. Recruitment is basically impossible without being extremely high level or lucky. The clan system is really only useful for requesting and chatting with friends. It could practically be an auction house and be the same in usability.,4,2018-12-06 15:22:40
"Not gonna lie this is an amazing game. If you play it too long it may die out, like on me. But have to admit they have changed so much to the game but kept the core mechanics the same. Only thing is you need time to play the game or atleast pay to continue in some scenarios. Great game. Definitely recommend strategic players to try it out for yourself!!!",4,2018-12-07 00:40:06
"Honestly a very fun game, not too addictive and just as fun for casual gameplay as well as serious gameplay. Very simple to get the hang of and overall just a great game, i would probably rate the game itself 4-5 stars. However their suppory system is appalling. I have been trying for ages to find fixes for issues but seem unable to. The only 'help and support' they offer is a list of 50-100 questions, and if your question isn't on there, you're gonna have to solve it yourself. No live chats.",2,2019-08-27 17:44:34
"The gameplay itself is fun but over the years this game became way too greedy. Don't get me wrong lucky chests are good but the fact that they keep adding new stuff is annoying. First the champions (no big deal), then the Evo's (I mean it's ok) and now the heroes? What else do they plan on adding? And don't even get me started on the fact that they removed the season shop.",1,2026-01-01 22:46:36
I used to have fun with this game years ago. Now it became a game for people who pay to have more upgrades and more advantages. So new people get screwed. It's very hard to win a game in Clash Royale now. I tried several decks that used to work before but it doesn't matter because my towers and cards are lower level compared to other players. I always lose. They should balance the game allowing only players of the same level against each other. It's simply Unplayable!,1,2023-10-18 14:56:42
"Played it very actively for over a year but then quit 4 years ago. I downloaded it again to check it out for a day, and was sad to note that the same issues plague this otherwise great game. There are a lot of new cards, but the common/rare ones are complete garbage. The best decks in the game still include 3+ specific legendaries, which are really hard to get if you're free to play. At least you get two or three guaranteed legendaries as you level up now but there's like 15 of them by now...",3,2022-02-11 15:06:17
"Done done and done with this game, I recently installed this again thinking I'd give it another shot. There is no change whatsoever.....in fact it's got worse. Such unfair gameplay. First of all the matchmaking is pathetic, it's pay to win. Unless you are willing to pay loads of money to buy the best characters you are not going to level up and you will lose every match (so frustrating 😡) The elixir is tampered with on certain matches. The fun has gone from it. FIX IT SUPERCELL!",1,2021-06-06 01:04:53
"Have been playing for more than 3 years, and this has been the final straw. Laggy servers, unexplained prices, and awfully pay 2 win. Prepared to get nothing but misery and years of getting tilted with them not giving anything for you. It has been one of the very best games I have played, but now has become the very worst I have seen. This had been a great journey, but as the hero lived long enough to become the villain, this game has become too much of a pain to play.",1,2018-12-30 22:34:35
"Updated review from returning player. This still is the best game of its kind. You can play without spending money, however spending will help you advance a little quicker. The grind can be fun but once you get to higher levels it's less about skills and strategy and really about what deck do you have. Again, fun game, best of its kind but it gets very repetitive at a high level. Not much room for actual strategy",2,2024-11-04 21:18:49
"I used to have fun playing this game until they nerfed the pass royale progression and now gives 1/3 of what it used to. On top of that, they tripled the cost of the pass. They added a new level, which adds nothing to the game, and this time, it is very costly and nearly impossible to max a deck. Costing 100 champions for a single level 15 card and books only work towards 1/10 of a level 15 upgrade. They've ruined the game and given an unfair advantage to spenders. This game is dying. Delete",2,2023-06-21 14:45:20
"If you like to play games without spending money then play this, and lose every single game you play. Clash Royale is the biggest pay to win game on the app store. Sure it's a fun game in the lower levels but theres a point when you start playing people with 2 levels higher than you and their cards are way better, not to mention their extra health on the tower's. I could recommend this game to people that have lots of money to spend and people who are absolutely never mad or frustrated.",1,2020-04-05 21:01:55
"I am experiencing lagging, poore connectivity to the server. I have played on wifi, on data, on different locations and with the same issue. I wrote to the customer service and...ignored me. And the main issue of the game is GOLD. I have lots of cards lvl 12 but no gold to upgrade them so those common, rare etc. tokens are no help. Only it gives you very, very few gold Maybe when I will retire I might have a chance to upgrade all the cards to lvl.13",1,2021-09-07 00:16:33
"Never able to get into the game after the Sep 30th update. It's either ""Login Failed"" or "" Connection Error"", or I think there is another error msg about the server or something. Tried uninstall-restart-reinstall for dozens of times but obviously didn't work. The help desk did not offer any helpful advice either. I shouldn't have complained about the frequent crashes earlier, cause at I could at least log in then. I liked the game a lot, but disappointed now. Hope the team could fix this soon.",1,2019-10-06 18:48:29
"So annoying, i can't play it anymore. It used to be so much fun, but right now you enjoy it only if you spend money on a monthly base to buy things. Whenever i click that battle button i always get opponents 11 or 12 tower level with troops level 14. Like why is even possible? You get destroyed in a sec. Sure for a company the more profit the better, but there should be a balance because its becoming tiring for a big number of players.",1,2023-07-01 03:16:08
"The card system and loadout system feels too bad and it seems like every loadout you pick will just be obliterated by another player that has a better loadout than you. It also feels like if you dont play this game for longer than 2 months you are way too behind and you will lose to any player and you will be set back a lot. The main problem with this game are cards, loadouts, and mainly the skill gap.",1,2019-05-05 10:24:37
"The brilliance of Clash Royale begins with its intuitive core gameplay. The objective is elegantly straightforward: destroy more of your opponent's towers than they destroy of yours within a limited time. Players simply drag and drop cards to deploy troops, spells, and buildings. This low barrier to entry ensures that newcomers can jump into the action without a steep learning curve, making the game instantly understandable. Ps, i used ai",5,2025-10-23 00:25:04
"Pay to win. Used to be a fun strategy game, but over the years, they've made it much harder to have an enjoyable experience without paying ridiculous amounts of money. It still has its moments, but they are overshadowed by seemingly unwinnable games and constant toxic behavior from other players. Also, the app frequently restarts in the middle of games, ruining the few games that are fairly matched. This was my go-to time killer for a long time, but it looks like it's time to find something new",1,2024-09-26 23:39:33
"Game is so bad I can't even Install it. Just goes to 90% and stops. I've had the game on other devices before, same issue occurred. The one time I actually was able to download and play the game I had a terrible experience. Horrible skill based match making, impossible to play unless you use the broken cards, and extremely laggy. I would spawn into a fight with my king tower at half health points.",1,2021-10-10 01:22:50
"I would've given this 5 stars if this issue didn't keep happening to me. The game crashes unexpectedly but often when I'm opening chests... Which is to me one of the most rewarding experiences of the game. I'm afraid to buy any chests now as I'm quite sure that my money will be wasted. I just tried to open a big chest and was so excited and I got two cards out of it before it crashed. I'm so upset! I really wish the company would fix that issue, I am so frustrated that I want to give up the game entireIy.",4,2020-11-25 04:56:29
"Maybe the developers have given up on the game, but why can't they see the problem with a character when almost everyone has it in their deck. Firecrackers everywhere, all of the time. The game needs balanced. There's other favourites but you simply can't play a game without there constantly being a firecracker in play. She's too cheap and her damage is too strong. Oh, but let's make her evolve, that'll be a great idea 😆",2,2023-08-11 19:25:22
"Used to be one of my favorites, but I feel like it's slowly dying. Favorite content creators have slowly stopped creating content because it stopped getting views. Feels like the company just wants cash grab after cash grab. Used to have a good sense of progression with the monthly pass, but now the value of passes and shop deals have gone down drastically. The game is free to play, but if you are you will start progressing real slow after the first few arenas. I really hope it gets better.",2,2024-04-02 12:57:39
"Used to be great. Everytime you start to catch up they shift everything so you have to buy a ton. It's a cash grab. Game is fun, but infuriating when you put so much time to max out each card, then they raise the max...also, when u finally do remax them, you'll still get the cards in chests, so they don't even help you. I'm gonna uninstall if it keeps this up. I wouldn't get invested in it. Too frustrating to have to pay to win. If all else is equal, fun strategy game. But it's not equal.",2,2023-08-22 23:51:42
"Imagine an uno player try this game, and well that player is me. The game is a great time passer game the matches mostly take about 1-3 mins of gameplay. I just wish that they added a feature where I can save my gameplays to my device saying that I'm a content creator of many games already and I wanted to edit it. But still, its a great game until you reach a point where you'll feel stuck, keep pushing and you'll reach to the last arena. Goodluck on playing and I hope you reach your goal.",4,2021-12-07 11:41:39
"The game is in a heavy downward spiral with how the game is being handled. It is becoming such an issue that content creator and pro players are losing favor in the game. I feel nothing but anger when I'm playing. I installed and reinstalled the game 5 times, I believe. It's final this time since there is no point in someone picking up the game again or for the first time unless they are certain they want to spend money. There is no optional part anymore if you want to actually progress.",1,2024-07-03 21:36:17
"I've been playing this game for a year. Got a new phone and couldn't sign back into my account. For some reason, it continuously updates and stuck on the update until it crashes. I started a new account rebooted my phone and I played for a few weeks and then it went back to updating. And just stuck on the update until it crashes unplayable. I'm glad I didn't spend money on this. That's too bad! I wanted to spend money on this now. It taught me not to trust phone games anymore",1,2024-05-19 09:34:52
"Save your money. The game is very unfair. It makes you play with higher level players all the time. I think it is all about money. The more you pay the easier matches you get. Level 8 players against level 10 and 11 players mathematically very difficult. Not fun for new players who are just growing. Clan wars require you to have 4 decks of 8 troops, which is 32. It won't be easy to level them all up easily and you will face a lot of unfair matches and unnecessary stress in your life.",1,2021-10-09 23:59:34
"Still playing it hoping the bot issue will be corrected . Seems the game will let u win 3 in a row, then take u down , over and over till u drop 1 or 2 arenas, This game would be great, if not for the 3rd party interference from bots, it allows them to cream u in minutes , they can toss out tons of high level troops that u cannot do, we an only work with 10 elixer drops at a time . So very frustrating, and if not fixed soon the game is gone, been playing from day 1, and the fun is getting ruined",1,2018-09-23 10:18:03
"Games fun and all. Ok, progression system, different decks are all fun to use and whatnot, and visuals are really good for such a simple game. Only gripe, really, like everyone else has already said, is the ""pay to win"" aspect. Playing players with max cards in lower arenas isn't fun at all, and almost garuntees a loss. Fun game, though, if it weren't so geared towards pay to win gameplay. Bummer...",3,2024-05-12 09:26:57
"This isn't a strategy game. online battles devolve into who's played the game longer, and who got the legendary cards. Half of the time I would lose battles because my opponent would spawn absurd amounts of high value units far faster than I could. It seemed like the bar that fills to let you place units was just slower for me, because it would take me several seconds to spawn something, and it seemed like my opponent could spawn two per second for the sane thing.",1,2020-08-23 12:48:58
"Decent game, if you have never played this game before its OK at first and I do like the card feature. However, after a while it gets very repetitive, the war system isn't great and the chests are way to expensive considering you might not even get a legendry.

"The game WAS fun. But that was before they decided to go more heavily into in-app purchases and making it a pay-to-win game. It used to be pretty competitive but now if you buy anything to give you a leg up, you can't be beaten. The same goes for opponents. Unless you pay for the 2000+ gem chests (which translates to roughly $100 in real currency) then you'll get the same 5 cards over and over and over again. The game offers no room to grow.",1,2023-05-11 00:23:21
"I have been playing this game for 6 years. Since the early and good days of it. The game was fun, challenging, and most importantly fair. However, through the recent years, it's like the game devs ate shifting more toward ""pay to win"", and it was at this point which marked the beginning of a downfall of the game. Imagine you have been playing the game for years, with so much experience and decent amount of resources, just to be beaten by someone who bought their way and maxed out everything.",1,2023-08-11 13:04:36
"I've played this game before multiple times, but I always ended up uninstalling it after a few months because of how repetitive and frustrating it gets. If that wasn't enough, they decide that it's a great idea to change multiple things about their game, making it more heavily p2w, and seeing as how the only way to progress fast is mostly paying for absurd things, it's just not worth playing as much. I am disappointed with how Supercell has gone this horrible path, and I want to see them fix it",1,2024-07-08 07:55:15

I am able to recover my progress, but it'll happen 5 minutes after a last login. But I've been helping my young son to build himself a game. He's worked very hard, gotten to level 5, and was really proud. Supercell wiped his game today. I have no idea if I can get it back. I'm livid. Garbage company and game.",1,2020-12-28 01:28:15
"Warning: recent changes have ruined the game, it is completely different to previous years. It's very sad to see one of the best games from the 2010s, of any genre, be tainted by corporate greed - to such an extent that it is now not only Pay To Win, but Pay To Play. Supercell have been monetising the game to within an inch of its life, with the introduction of Level 15, plus card evolutions - you now can't even compete in higher sections of the main game mode unless you spend a lot of money",1,2023-12-09 10:50:52
"Just uninstalled. It was a really good game, kept me entertained for months. It really was, but as you progress, it starts being a bit different.

Some players join clans but do not participate as there's no tutorial for it whatsoever.",3,2022-11-26 05:02:07
The latest update has made it so that the chest timer resets randomly when closing the game when it is a queued chest. I got the league pass to help with the game but instead has been a detriment. After reaching out to support they said its a known issue and they are working on it but was nothing they could do. Waiting almost 2 days for a chest is a big issue. I probably won't get the league pass again.,1,2019-07-16 19:57:23

You either get three stars or you get three-stared. SOMETHING TO NOTE IS THE SEASON PASS. I have noticed that if you purchase the season pass, the match making algorithm is much friendlier... but then again, this review might not even matter because it most likely will get burried and forgotten because of its content.",1,2023-11-03 09:29:29

They have increased the cost of the premium by 25% and decreased the bonuses you get for it, and then to add insult, they now have en even more expensive tier for double what it used to cost, only to get what you used to get for half the price. You are selling virtual items with zero expense. You are officially ripping off your customers. I will never give Supercell money again. This is too far.",2,2023-04-04 10:37:26

Up to now, with all the new paid buffs, it is simply impossible to play without paying, in freemium game model to destroy the balance in such a way is suicide! Good luck with keeping you player audience with a 5% win rate for non paying player. It really sucks you destroyed the game. Goodbye.",1,2020-03-03 03:02:55
"It was good when it launched. Now its just pay to win. I am always matched against a higher level player once i cross a certain threshold in trophies so basically I'm stuck at one place. I have to wait like this for long time or i can buy ton of gems and level up my cards fast. The developers getting greedy day by day. They are more focused on cosmetics and less on mechanics & matchmaking, so this is a pay to win basically.",1,2022-10-25 19:01:37
"Out of every game in the world, this is the biggest example of wasted potential. The core mechanics of the game are brilliant, however the game is completely unplayable without either years of grinding OR as supercell wants, no exaggeration, hundreds of dollars. Every update compounds this problem, and the developers clearly have no interest in improving the game, only in making more money. A true shame, as the gameplay itself would have made it the perfect mobile game if it was only fair.",2,2023-06-27 17:20:07
"Played for years, spent some $, and I expect to pay for good entertainment. However, now you have to spend money regularly, just to keep up. Beyond that, it's hard to figure what the point is. I think the game has stalled, and creator direction is haphazard at best. Seems like constant tweaks to keep money rolling in for no real improvement in experience. Play BB as well, and same story... tired of supercell.",1,2024-06-23 03:15:36
"I played this game from the starting, I took break for few years, when after long time started to play I noticed something wrong, then I found many of my unlocked cards are gone, all my legendary cards also gone. Now it is like playing the game from the scratch, and as cherry on top, the match become frozen in middle even though my network, memory everything was good, disappointing 😞.",1,2023-06-15 17:45:39
"Great game, occasionally you'll come across people who pay to play but you dont have to spend money to enjoy 2021: I have been playing this game off/on for the last 4 years and sadly it has become saturated with loot boxes & pay to play mechanisms. The last 4 years is proof that there is an algorithm which prevents you from collecting and maxing the cards you most use, without spending money. It's akin to gambling, it really sucks that a lot of kids play this and are used to pay to win games.",2,2021-10-28 14:18:46
"It was really enjoyable until it wasn't. I'm all for giving a company money, especially when the product is free. But Supercell has littered both coc/cr with micro transactions ranging from the prices of full AAA game titles. In the past, I thought the grind was fun, and paying for gems was a helpful boost. Now, they just can't help themselves and stunt all progress for players who are having too fun and not paying (enough).",1,2023-05-19 01:15:09
"The advertisement on YouTube shows the person who is losing using the 'angry character' and him saying 'Hold Hold' but when you play, it is some one who is ranked higher than you (or a lower rank that spent money and every character is ranked 14 or higher) talking trash. You could be better but it really doesn't matter. Frustrating game, making them millions though, keep spending!",1,2022-04-24 08:31:48
"The game lacks progression. I have been playing for two years and there is an inherent problem. First off it takes too long to level up. I have long sinced stopped purchasing micros as I cannot afford it. It isnt a matter of price, the amount of money it would take for a brand new player to become competetive is ridiculous. On top of this you must be a part of a clan to enjoy any casual play. And I'm not on enough for clans to want to keep me around.",1,2019-02-10 01:36:56
"Ca$h Royale used to be my favorite game, but recent changes have ruined it. I played since launch and bought many of the $5 passes. I tried playing for the first time in months a few days ago with mortar and lost to someone playing hog, eq, and lvl 15 evo firecracker. The only way for me to gain trophies would be to spend even more money, which seems to be what the devs want. Goodbye cr, youll be remembered, but not missed.",1,2023-07-14 00:30:43
"Played this game on and off for years. Makes the game difficult when some players use ""cheats"". Have played against some where the creatures made are impossible to make as quickly as they have. And when watching the battle back, the opponents elixir bar fills suspiciously fast. No way you can make a mega knight, pecka, with support before they cross to your side of the field.",1,2022-01-14 18:15:22
"I'm sorry to say that this game is no longer brilliant. It is definitely aimed at pay to win players. The December update has made it impossible to upgrade cards by trading because both players need a trade token and who'd waste one of those on a trade they didn't particularly want. Also higher players tend not to donate cards anymore as they have to pay to do so once they're max level. Terrible. Fix this. This was my 5 star review:""I download a lot of games but end up uninstalling them as I get bored. I have played this everyday for almost a year and have not been bored the entire time. You can play as much or as little as you like and works well whether you want a free to play game or a pay to win game. Brilliant.""",4,2020-08-31 20:39:54
"I have been playing this game for many years (at least since 2018/2019, if not earlier. I used to LOVE this game, I made friends and family download it so we could play together, and it was a blast! I had great times and really enjoyed farming my way up. Since the introduction of the ""double battle pass"" and evolutions, I think they've been pushing a bit too much into the hard currency rewards/pay to advance mechanics, but what I personally find worse of all is the endless scrolling in the UI",1,2023-10-30 19:19:02
"I love that Clash Royal is finding ways to create longevity in the game. In my last review, that was the change I wanted to see and gold being easier to get. I feel that was accomplished but at a huge cost to the free to play community where even the pass, which I use to buy, is not worth it to be buying monthly. I love that there is more to do but now progression is hard and not as enjoyable with all the additional features stunting F2P in relevance in the game.",3,2023-12-14 08:20:31
This game is great it runs on most devices with no lag (maybe internet lag but nothing they can do to fix that) and has action packed matches what last up to 5 mins. You can play the game without spending anything but the game tempts you into it. I have spent maybe £10 on it and I'm at a pretty high trophy count missing only 2 cards. One problem is smurfs. Every 3-5 games you will encounter someone 3 levels above you and there is nothing you can do. Anyway great game would recommend!,4,2020-06-04 06:06:13
"Just another pay2win game You can play normally at certain point with basic cards, but after a time, you'll get opponents with higher level towers and cards than yours, that its almost impossible to win, not only the matchmaking gets horrible, the chances to get good card are extremely rare, and once you get you're stuck in the same level for a long time, if you want to have fun for a time and delete go for it, but if not you'll be forced to spend money to keep going up.",2,2024-04-15 04:12:51
"Great game, fun and somehow strategic. However, the ""pay to win"" royale pass is unfair for players who did not purchase the pass. One might play for a year and work their way to a level 12, while a player with the pass could reach higher levels in 6 months. The best solution is to match players according to their status, that is, if they have paid for credits or not.",4,2020-06-19 19:59:47
"I've always enjoyed this game when the game first came out. The game was fun and you needed skill and patience to gain wins. Now it's practically RNG with higher card levels and the algorithm match making. If you're looking to have fun, this is not the game to choose. Most of the player base is competitive sweats, trust me, I'm one of them. It's very frustrating to play as you can't have fun making your own decks anymore. It's all just ""meta"" no individuality. Supercell has been trying too hard.",2,2022-11-21 09:50:48
"I tried getting back into this game after several years away, and I can't believe how monetized it has become. The mechanism to upgrade cards to level 15 and getting evolutions is specifically designed to nickle and dime any player that wants to be competitive. Battle pass is more than twice the cost it used to be, and now there are other tracks to buy that need further purchases the further you progress on them. The game itself is still fun if you can ignore the money grabbing.",2,2024-12-31 06:31:57
"Definitely my most played mobile game. 2025 Update: I took a long break from the game and reinstalled to see the new content... and man it's bad. They somehow found a way to make the game even more pay to win with the unfair evolutions, which are just better, overpowered versions of troops that are extremely difficult to get without paying for them. Was fun to try out the new troops they added then I uninstalled after seeing evo firecracker for the 100th time in a row. Not worth it.",2,2025-06-04 18:18:40
"Been playing with my clan since 2016. We've all lost interest over the past 6 months. We're maxed out with nowhere to go. The season pass isn't exciting by any means and its laughable for $5. They need something big. More levels, cards, arenas, modes, CUSTOMIZATION... even the Clan Wars 2 update is blah. Battle ship defenses for minimal rewards of the saaaaame stuff.",3,2020-11-18 22:13:41
"It was fun for a little while, and then the strategy became nothing but stall on the original version. I was gone for a bit, and when I came back, they had party mode. That's where you could earn chests while playing interesting games like 3x elixir, but with the update today, they took that away. Uninstalled just now and not looking back, party mode was the last fun bit keeping me holding on and buying the season pass.",1,2023-03-28 06:49:28
"In the usual CR fashion, the new update is riddled with source code and algorithm issues. Mostly in the 2V2 mode but it can be seen across the entire platform. Once again we see the uneven game matching as well as the return of the super elixirs. Good luck non pay to play gamers. If you're in it for the long haul, it will certainly be a tough ride. Our suggestion is to find another game to play until the super brains at supercell fix it.",1,2019-10-09 18:41:29
"I would just like to say that this game was really fun for the first 5000 trophies, but afterwards, it became a pay 2 win unbeatable mess. I'll go up 100 trophies and drop due to overleveled cards, cards that shouldn't be obtainable in the current arena, and the constant reminder of such being shown in the store with 8 offers showing up before you get to free items which by the way aren't even that great. Supercell, you are a money hungry company that couldn't care less about their playerbase.",2,2024-02-23 12:22:18
"Great game if you enjoy paying to win. Great opportunities to have fun, but you are limited due to the restraints of the game wanting you to spend money on chests, chest unlocks, Pass Royale, emotes, etc. Also, with Pass Royale being introduced, players who purchase it get bonuses that give them an edge over other players. That would be fine if the game were not considered ""Free to Play""; however, it is not.",3,2019-07-29 10:53:45
"Gameplay is pretty solid, all things considered. However, many units are simply poor and shouldn't be in the game anyway. The evolution mechanic is trash, and again, shouldn't be in the game. What inspired me to leave a poor review most, however, is the Shop, which has become a pit of mud. I counted today: 16 different $ offers before I could see the free shop. They keep making things worse for F2P. For example, they thought it would be a good idea to lower free content in the pass royale. Trash",1,2024-04-06 21:17:44
"very average and honestly not too fun, but can sometimes be enjoyable. this is because of the fact that you just fight others, have to wait hours to progress through the game and upgrade things, and decks can be easily overpowered and can take down anyone, which is unfair, and not fun. Sometimes it is fun and fair, but it isn't that often, which also makes it not fun. it's ok I guess.",4,2018-12-23 14:04:18
"Great mechanics and we'll thought out, I love the animation and the wide variety of characters. Although these are good it is heavily dependent on the money you spend for more cards, but this can not compare to the community. Ever since day one I have been spammed by taunts everyone I lose. The game play it's self can get repetitive after awhile as well.",4,2018-12-01 09:29:55
"This game has so much potential. It immediately presents itself as a fair 1v1 deck building game where you outskill your opponent and strategize to become victorious, but it becomes obvious fairly quickly that any amount of skill can be easily replaced with a few dollars from your credit card. The game is filled to the brim with loot boxes and the rarest cards that could come out of those boxes or the ""legendary"" cards are incredibly overpowered. Tl;dr: pay to win, not worth your time.",1,2022-02-24 21:43:27
"I've been playing for years and have never been this disappointed. From removing chests from party mode, ruining POL by making it a mode that takes twice the time to play, and killing pass royale, every single change they've made has been for the worst. I'm a pretty busy person and enjoyed playing party mode for a more casual experience, and liked grinding quick 3 min games on POL, can't do that now. I've been an on and off pass buyer, but I'll never buy it again unless the changes are reverted.",1,2023-04-16 04:35:31
"Last week I got my 4 year badge, I've been enjoying this game for that long. Since the latest update, I lost all enjoyment in this game. Now if you don't mind spending 6 or 12 dollars a month, this game is for you. For free-to-play players like myself, will have to play catch up every year they add a new card level. Card leveling is not fun, and with the new update; progression has been slower. Core game play is still fun, but not if you're stuck with your one or two fully leveled up deck.",1,2023-03-30 00:12:45

A whole ~12 us dollars for rewards that don't do too much(also considering that the rewards included so much previously for only $5!). Additionally, with level 15 coming sometime in the future, clash isn't looking to good. And I thought level 14 would be the last of it... The final straw has been pulled.",1,2023-04-30 06:43:23
"For the love of God please lower the cool down for clan wars! It's better than it was, slightly. But the cool down time is just ridiculous. I feel like you should be able to get two rounds of attacks in per day. In theory clan wars is awesome but in practice it's really just annoying and I feel forced into it. I run a clan and unfortunately due to the lack of ability to opt in/out of war I've had to kick so many people. There should be an option to partake in war like in COC. Please change!",2,2020-11-28 07:22:39
"So this is how the algorithm works now - you win 2-3 games at a stretch and then start loosing. After loosing some matches you win one or two and again start loosing. In the sometimes they'll give you a huge trophy push, and then bring you down so that you are hooked to gaining back the lost trophies. This makes the game addictive in a frustration way. I used to play this before, then stopped, again started. But from now I'll never play this anymore. Also it's so pay to win now.",1,2025-06-07 16:19:11
it was fun!!! but once they made the game more about spending money it become so annoying. this game is made in such way that u will not enjoy it if you don't spent money. 4 years ago it was the best mobile game and now it just feels like they don't care much about fairness. I was tower level 12 with all my troops are either level 12 or 13. I faced player that had tower level 11 but units that were maxed out. it shouldn't be that way. if u want to download it make sure you have money to spent.,1,2020-06-07 22:12:10
"I have been seeing many people say this is pay to win. That is not entirely fair. I have been playing for 5 years... I have leveled up my cards over that time, so have thousands of others. That being said, yes, you can pay to level cards more quickly. And they often nurf cards that don't need it, and kill cards completely by over compensating... I don't like it as much as I used to but it is still fun for a match our two every day",4,2021-06-11 19:34:50
"The unlock times are so freaking long. Don't get me wrong, the gameplay is very good, but damn it puts a damper on things. Yeah, you can play even if the chest queue is full but dn, it feels so unrewarding if you do since you don't get anything... I understand that you need to timegate stuff supercell, but the way you went about it is... Pretty poorly thought of to say it nicely.",3,2019-01-20 06:44:35
"For Supercell: You may have heard this but yes, chest opening time needs to be more flexible. There should be a system to encourage more playtime to decrease chest opening time when full. Else, it feels hopeless when you already have 4 chests and playing again does nothing.      To Players: It is a great new concept from CoC but the cards paid players have are far too good. So do keep in mind that if you are not going to pay, however skilled you are, it is almost impossible to trophy push to the top.",4,2019-11-27 20:17:03
"Last patch completely wrecked this game. Everything that may be of interest is now locked behind pay walls. As a veteran player, the only thing I had to look forward to was the possibility of new backgrounds. Use to be able to farm gems in hopes of getting the ones i wanted. Now that is next to impossible. The ones you CAN get get by doing dailies are not so great and bland. Overall, I only log in occasionally to kill time. I use to pay the $5.99 pass but now rewards from that are lacking.",1,2023-05-18 08:32:15
"Like the game and they have finally strick a balance between pay and non-pay to win players. The game is not perfect, but it is quite good. The monthly balance does get annoying at times, as they take cards with high win rates and ""nerf"" them. Typically new cards come in overpowered and there's a race to use them and purchase opportunities to get them only to have the card depowered within the next couple of updates.",4,2019-10-18 02:19:13
"this game have a very weird way of playing. just by paying more money can make you stronger, and was usually make the game one-sided, since the person who can actually amass an army of at least 2 epics, especially the Giant skeleton, can most certainly take a tower with them upon their death. and also, when you're trying to go up an arena, and the enemy was one arena on top of you, usually taunts you and make the experience worse. they also lacks the sense of sportsmanship.",1,2019-09-10 19:38:27

When this was released a couple years back, it was absolutely amazing and supercell made a masterpiece. Now, all they care about is money. Making a battle pass that gives huge competitive advantage to those who buy it. Matchmaking that puts me up against level 10s and every now and then 11s when I'm level 9 with higher level cards.

So it will force you to spend real money, to achieve what other p2w players has achieved. It will only give you opponents that are higher level than you. It's not strategy, it's unbalance and p2w game. It's not a hate, I've been playing this game for more than two years, and I only have two cards upgraded at max lvl))",1,2019-04-10 20:55:35

You should be able to change your name as many times. But either than that it is a good game. I change my mind. I have been playing this gane since the dawn of time and the state it's currently in is just sad. They chase nothing but profit by forcing you to play against people who are in higher levels than you so that you are enticed to buy in-game purchases. The season resets are also a way to make you pair with higher level players. Game is not fun and I would not reccomend downloading it!!!!,1,2021-01-15 07:19:12

I bought one of the special offers yesterday, and was double charged. When I reported that I was double charged Supercell wiped out some of my deck that I had before the offer to correct their error.

people to pay for diamonds, pay for chests (which still not guaranteed a

up wasting your money for no reward.",1,2022-12-12 19:08:27

(At the time of writing this, I'm level 11 in legendary arena). The progression is also a grind as cards cost exponentially more gold as you go along while the rewards don't scale enough. It's not worth buying gems in this game as the normal chests are overpriced for what they give. (20$ for a guaranteed legendary) It's a somewhat fun grind.",4,2021-01-02 23:57:49
"Game is fixed, don't be the first person to put a card down. Which means make sure you have a few good defensive cards. If you don't place the right card at the right time you're game is basically over. Which is difficult given the obvious lag that the developers have never fixed. Some cards say they do certain things, then they don't. Don't buy anything here, basic time waster of a game.",2,2021-02-15 06:28:51

Not fun when 3 pekka appear early on, and I'm elixir counting. It's fun but frustrating, which is why I gave it a lower score. Game is also extremely, and I mean EXTREMELY unbalanced.

Game starts of enjoyable than you reach a point where every match you go against cards 4 levels higher than yours, this makes it almost impossible to win unless your opponent is completely incapable.

I won't be paying and soon probably won't be competitive, which probably means not playing (or paying!) much longer...",1,2023-04-04 00:47:54
"0/5 stars. Ever since you moved the 2v2 modes, no one plays them anymore. Can't find any games because it takes 10 minutes to find them. ALSO I exclusively played the party modes ever since it was a main attraction to the game, which you recent hid in the menu. I specifically paid to upgrade my cards for these modes, I've maxed out at least 4 of cards. Now there is a cap to them. So ALLLLLL the money I spent is wasted. I will be submitting a refund claim to Google Play.",1,2023-03-29 19:42:47
Pay to win. Rigged arcade-like game reminiscent of old coin-op machines where you were destined to lose no matter how well you played. Which is fine (because the developer can do whatever they want to make money.) The truly sad part is that people think that half the time they are playing other people!! That is a misrepresentation by the company. Half the time you are simply playing the comp. Ends up just being frustrating and no fun. Find another game to waste time in and don't stress about CR.,1,2022-11-14 08:59:57
"Originally a really fun game. It deserved the 5 stars I gave it in 2016. Now in 2024. This game could disappear off the app store I wouldn't care. Prices of micro transactions is crazy high for what they are. Cards are really unbalanced. I single card could destroy my whole deck. It's kinda ridiculous. ""Oh the game is teaching you how to play"" no the game is teaching me to spend money if I want cool stuff. Good luck supercell, you've become a joke of a company in my opinion",1,2024-04-06 07:42:00
Fallen from grace. This still is one of the best mobile real-time-strategy games but I just cannot recommend it after all the predatory changes to the monetization system. You will like it at first but eventually the gameplay becomes unfun as you must bang your head against the wall that is max level decks which you will never be able to obtain.,2,2025-03-01 21:05:40
"Disappointed that there aren't any safe guards to prevent accidental emote purchases. There should be a second pop-up that asks if you're sure you would like to purchase this emote so you can click yes purchase, or no do not. Instead they basically tell you ""too bad so sad, we can't reverse it because it would be unfair and others would take advantage of that feature"". They expect you to spend more money on gems in order to immediately replace what you accidentally spent, so more $ for them.",1,2020-11-30 02:27:50
"I am furious. I bought a gold pack with money that you guys have claimed that I requested a refund for. Whereas in my Google account I have 0 refund requests or transactions and the money is missing from my bank account. Customer service basically told me ""There's nothing we can do, but you can buy more gold!"" Don't make purchases on this game cause if something goes wrong, they WILL NOT HELP YOU.",1,2022-09-13 03:43:03
"I played the game for a long time through many updates and I can say without a doubt that it is terrible. It's pay-to-win posing as a free game and the amount of money the game makes is ridiculous considering how lazy it is. Unbalanced to the point of having an undeniable meta, bad players drop ranks so they can win battles and even with a good connection it will lag so bad that you will miss entire battles. Essentially the game is saying ""Pay for me so you can play the way I want you to play."".",1,2020-06-02 11:26:56
"Similar to the other reviews I've seen, I've had this game pretty much since release and it has become noticeable how pay to win the game has become. You can reach the higher rankings simply by spending money when it used to take skill and strategy. Still a fun game, but not something to get too invested in if like me you don't wish to spend money.",3,2021-11-17 01:55:51
"Been playing for more than 3years. They make it easy for you to play at the start, but makes it almost Impossible to win unless you pay for upgrades later on. In the end, strategy doesn't matter since you will be matched with level13/14 paying players who haven't even played a long time. At least in PUBG upgrades are cosmetic and doesn't affect your game performance. This game is all about making money. Don't waste your time. Oh this causes Screen Burn in over time.",1,2021-01-07 21:14:49
"The game itself is fun, but if you haven't been playing for years or aren't willing to pay up, you're not going to make much progress. Lowered from 4 to 3 stars due to the 2nd evolution slot being locked behind king level 15. I accept Supercell wants to make money, but it's gotten to the point where they're just sabotaging their own game to try and squeeze more cash out of players.",3,2024-03-15 04:46:53
"It's definitely the worst game of Supercell nowadays. Each update they are monetizing everything in the game. Battle pass, Golden Bank and, especially, the ""best"" offers in the shop. Balance of the game became pay to win battles where you will be stuck for a long time before you upgrade to a level on which you will be able to make some progress on your path. I was playing this game from the release of it, feeling bad about these changes to my favorite game then.",1,2023-07-10 17:17:21
"Theres no balance in this game whatsoever. Higher level players can ruin the experience of lower level players pretty much at will. Pay to win or get screwed over that's the SuperCell way I guess. You would think they would put you up against players with similar skill level, but no. It puts you against pros on an ult constantly. It's all about thier precious esport. I've been playing for more than a year with little to no reward for being dedicated to the game. The CRL fantasy had a thing you were suppose to be able to click for rewards in game..... if you were on a phone during the event you were just out of luck, because it didn't work. They care about money and that's all. Dont download it, it's a waste of time and money.",1,2018-12-01 18:45:19
"I have spent untold thousands of hours on this game. The core gameplay is the best game ever made. However, the last few updates have been shifting the game towards more and monetization. Games need to make money, but it shouldn't lock away gameplay. There is so much potential for more cosmetics. Charge through the roof for skins, for customising your side of the arena etc. I would pay so much to get a limited edition brand deal starwars lightsaber for a mini pekka, or whatever. Not level 15!",1,2023-06-18 10:15:51
"a very rigged and pay to play game. too many overpowered bots once they hook you by making it super easy to advance (at first). Do not spend money or the game gets harder because they know you'll spend money to advance. one of the most ""rigged"" games in the store. It's fun but frustrating. play only if you don't get triggered easily. it uses the push pull system, you win some you lose some and it has nothing to do with skill. it's almost criminal how rigged this game is. very much like a casino.",1,2025-11-09 23:01:55
"It's a good game but hard to be a casual player. If you want to play for free, there comes a point where you can't hope to compete because your cards are too underpowered. Spending real money to upgrade your cards is a waste of time for the average player because you're looking at literally thousands of pounds to max out your account, at which point you're up against the big boys, and essentially in the same boat as when your cards were underpowered, except you've blown all your cash.",1,2024-08-03 05:06:58
"Great app, but still waiting for ability to queue all chests, not just 1 after the current unlocking chest. Sometimes people do not log on because they can't, and chests are left unlocked for a day or so. And the feature is nice, but why not include up to all 4 chests?? instead of just one. 4 stars until that change is made. Thanks! Maybe make the 1 queued chest free, and all 4 part of buying the pass. Also, it feels like they got lazy with note ratio. Bottom buttons are ugly stretched...",4,2019-10-18 03:33:42
"So I already had a review on this game in which I ranted about how the Royale Pass made the game too pay to win. However, there have been recent updates allowing free to play players to progress easier, and it is much appreciated. Unfortunatley, there are still cases in where you get matched up against players that have much better things than you, making the game unbalanced, so alot of balance changes have yet to be made. After that, it will be five stars from me.",4,2020-12-12 01:10:54
"Words cannot describe how much I hate this game. After trying (and failing) to get to the legendary arena they add in two more arenas within the same hour I finally get there. You cannot get ahead in the game unless you pay for chests or their ""totally not pay to win"" magical items that can instantly level up any card and upgrade it for free... for the low low price of five dollars. On top of that the game will decide that you have won too much and match youup against someone whois leagues ahed",1,2021-10-04 16:44:54
"after playing on and off for a significant amount of time I've decided how I feel about this game, its fun but its flawed to the point where even casual play becomes a chore. The game is pay to win at its core, to win games you need to level your cards, cards are leveled using gold and extra cards, cards can be bought using gold, gold can be bought using gems and gems are bought using real money. it quickly becomes unenjoyable as you wont progress very quickly without paying.",2,2019-06-12 19:19:48
"Working as a software tester led me to realise that no program could ever be perfect. However, there are some glaring issues to this game, especially with the new update. 1. When doing clan war battles, if you get 2 or more victories (aka at least 1 tank broken), you should get 3 lucky drops. However, this is not the case. 2. The push back on how rewards are obtained in favor of some money is a kill-joy in my opinion, especially with no more in-game currency shop. Shadow what the game was tbh",2,2025-04-28 05:56:15
"This game used to be very fun, but I simply can not recommend it to anyone anymore. Since Clan Wars 2, every update has been worse than the last, and recently, the evolutions update was horrible and super P2W. This used to be a legitimately skillful and fun game. But not anymore. I even invested a few bucks, like 15 bucks on the passes a few seasons when the game was fun, but it's not anymore. It has been progressing more and more P2W, unlike other Supercell games. Don't bother starting now.",1,2023-08-13 03:45:20
"You might want to try and do a little work on the matchmaking algorithm that you use. You have these challenges to unlock new cards or cards that are harder to come by and somehow I am paired up against people with exponentially better cards - who (in reference to the rage challenge) already had the dang card. I am currently in Arena 10 and only have 3 legendary cards. I refuse to spend money on the game because I am quickly realizing that it is a pay to play game. I have been playing this game for a while now, this is my second account - got a new phone and lost the other account. I just wish you could either try and make the matchups a little closer or at least make it to where you can win without having to spend money, but then again that probably isn't something y'all want to do...oh well that's just my two cents",1,2018-10-22 11:18:59
"The recent addition of lvl 15,removal of gems from masterys and the changing of the pass of only made the game worse. and while the new evos are cool, they are greatly overshadowed by what has been taken from the average player. They made progression harder, more tedious, and less fun. The difference between free to play and paying players has never been more apparent.",1,2023-07-02 02:27:15
"This game has some serious balancing issues in matchmaking, I thought the game was supposed to be fair for everyone that played? Not just those who have high levels, I was playing against players that were level 9 when I was only a level 6. Extremely frustrating if you ask me for someone trying to kill some time by playing these kinds of apps. Not only do I cheated but it makes me not want to play this game anymore. Supper disappointed, please fix then I'll see if your rating goes up. Much Love❤",2,2021-12-15 19:18:34
"Dont waste your time. it was cool when you first start. but they really push spending your money. They do not have a costumer support team that can help with anyone's questions. they offer an AI generated help system that can only help you with 5 different subjects. After studying online, Im finding out nobody can ever get any support. Spent hours now trying to get my account back up, but they don't offer a way. Finally uninstalled for good.",1,2025-04-06 09:31:27
"When I started playing it was a perfect, simple game, now it's way overcomplicated and completely pay to win, it has left me no choice but to either pay or uninstall. The update that brought evolutions is pretty sick, but they are way too overpowered, and anyone can just pay to get them, while they could be free, so everyone is even. Such a twisted way of making money, hope you learn from your mistakes.",1,2025-08-16 06:15:14
"over years playing this game, it was fun at first, but with the recent update, it got boring, and it got a lot harder to get cards now, and really, with the mistake update. I hope they change their mind and add their chest again. Also, the tokens shops were good. I don't know why they removed that, too but I hope they bring it back and learn from their mistake",2,2025-04-26 08:32:43
"This used to be a 5 star game. The update to level 15 and card evolutions makes the gap between high spenders and no/low spenders so great that there's not really any point playing unless you're going to full on whale. I've given it a few months, thinking ""maybe it'll get better and I'll get used to it"" but there's no getting around it, a player with level 14 cards is simply outpowered by a player who spends and has a bunch of evolved level 15 cards.",1,2023-09-21 20:06:50
"I used to love this game, it was one of my absolute favorites when it came out, and it had some bad updates in the past, but they always bounced back. But the past two updates in a row have absolutely killed the game, the first one making the game pay to win and removing tons of rewards and value and overall nuking all of the fun in the game. It is not worth the grind anymore after that update alone, but then they added evolutions, which are literally pay to obtain. They're just milking a corpse",1,2023-07-09 08:01:03
"This game has been on a steady decline for years. To same the game hasn't always been p2w would be dishonest. But they suffer from the old saying ""Give an inch take a mile"" where they've been steadily seeing just how much they can increase the predatory monetization in the game. This latest update has been their most daring yet in this regard. Unless you're the type that likes to invest a house into their gaming experience I would not recommend this game at all.",1,2023-06-21 22:43:49
"I have been in here for a long while and I have spent some money as well. The game presentation is a hoax, along with the game itself. There exists no balance whatsoever, as supercell would have you believe, there are not even basic restrictions and rules, in order to make sure that the game is having a basic concept, it is an anarchic mumble jumble, sold as something else.",1,2018-12-23 20:42:04
"I hope to god they decide to actually balance out all the cards. Combine this with level differences because its a free-to-play game where you can buy stuff with real money, and it makes this game one of the most unfair, infuriatingly difficult to master games on the app store. Clash Royale is an embaressment to games with competitive play. You can't buy higher level characters in Overwatch. You can't buy more boost in Rocket League. What a joke.",1,2021-04-24 22:23:05
"Gameplay is fun but the game is entirely pay to win. If you aren't willing to spend money, you're going to have an awful time. Matchmaking pairs you vs players with higher leveled cards and king towers. The progression system is insanely slow. The balancing in the game is wildly lackluster. If you aren't planning on spending money, I do not recommend this game at all.",2,2022-08-10 23:03:50
"Let me completely honest. this game has fallen off so much it's unreal, it seems supercell is trying it's best to ruin this game for anyone who doesn't spend money on microtransactions. it's like call of duty all over again but on mobile. it is pathetic and scummy, it used to be bearable, you used to have so much things that would help you level up your cards as a free to play, I have been playing this game for around 4 years now- I recently unistalled it because the changes were too much.",2,2025-07-20 21:30:55
"This game used to be so much fun and one that I'd play with all my friends. Over the past year, however, Supercell has taken some of the most fun and rewarding things out of the game. They've raised the level cap, and turned to pass royale into a ""give us all your money"" type beat along with countless other things. This game may be beyond saving.",1,2023-04-08 09:05:04
"This game's goal is not to entertain you, but to make you buy at least something. The internal store is not an option, it is a prerequisite. A very large number of players with legendary cards and cards that you can only get through three or four arenas. Only a cyber-athlete who created a new account for fun will be able to play comfortably and grow at low levels.",2,2023-01-15 00:35:10
"This game used to be fun, but now it's a money-making scheme. They sell you on it being a free to play game, but the gap between a free to play player and someone who pays for perks like season passes is miles. Besides all that, I recently got scammed by them. It claimed that I made shop purchases that I didn't. When I went to inquire in the help section, they lied to me multiple times and tried to make it seem as though it was my problem even though I had proof it wasn't. I'm sick of this. 😔",1,2023-09-14 08:27:09
"With each update they make the game worse and worse. It is anti consumer and anti free to play, as to have any meaningful progression you need to spend money. This is already annoying enough, but add to that the fact that the pricing is horrendous, and you get a terrible progression system. The base game is fun enough one you get to max level, but of course to do that you must spend money, and all of the other game modes they add aren't fun, they are very basic. Do not recommend",1,2025-04-10 00:16:43
"The game at lower levels is luring and habit forming. At higher levels, no matter how many chests you open, the algorithm will not let you upgrade any card to level 10 or above at least not the cards that matter unless you purchase something from the clash royale shop. It draws unbalanced game for you to finally make a purchase for good cards. Fraudulent by design. They think people won't understand their trickery.",1,2023-03-27 23:31:12
"Tbh, this game is a quick crashgrab. If you're thinking about playing this game, just keep in mind that 90% of your progress speed is counting on how much you spend in the game. And the amount of gaslighting the developers did in the trailer for level 15 is crazy to me. It just goes to show how much they dont care about how the community feels. Level 15 has to be one of the most HORRENDOUS uptade added to this game. Horrible but hopefully still fixable. Hopefully the devs finally start listenin",1,2023-06-27 16:21:04

"Recently I've seen many negative reviews, and to make sure you can see both sides of the coin I am sharing my opinion. This is one of the best games for mobiles. It's has ton of different well thought mechanics, nice style, catching gameplay (like for sure, I'm playing for 5 years) it's made good, it is the original. People complain about card upgrading, they say it's too long, and you can speed up this process with purchases, you can, but it doesn't affect gameplay, only your skill will, enjoy",5,2021-11-01 21:35:20
"Years of play removed the shine.Most notably, the matching algorithm is garbage. The most generous interpretation is that you're forever matched against your best day. It's maddening when you just want a chest. I enjoy the gameplay, even if devs currently hate swarm mechanics. However, I am irritated by the chest timer mechanic, and the incessant demands for reviews are beyond annoying. That being said, it does seem to be a good game, even if the chest timers are -extraordinarily- frustrating.",3,2022-04-26 07:14:27
"This game always had a pay to win element, but after almost 5 years of playing, Supercell has turned their greed to overdrive, and largely ignores the feedback from their players. At this point, it's no longer fun to play, as you HAVE to spend just to be competitive. Avoid the game, unless you want to spend a lot of money on an old game that doesn't draw new players.",1,2023-06-28 11:54:44
"Greedy. The only thing the developers have in mind is fattening their own pockets. The recent balance changes and taking away the season shop while also implementing this new ranked system made the game (somehow) even more pay to win.

It's a fun game nonetheless and there's no other like it but I won't be playing it, unless something changes.",2,2025-08-04 16:48:27
"I don't see how a game that is so unbalanced as far as match ups are concerned deserves more than 1 star. If you pay to play I'm sure the game is more fun but, I will never waste my hard earned money on something that I can't physically own. The game is free to play to a certain point but, once you've reached that point good luck.

"Clash Royale is a very fun (and addictive) game. It is a extremely exciting mobile game, that forces you to stay calm under pressure. It is a fantastic game overall, except that it's pay-to-win. It's SUCH a big frustration, because, unlike a lot of other games, you don't pay for cosmetics. You actually pay for the most overleveled stuff. I don't pay a cent, and it is really hard to keep up with all the overleveled/pay2win players out there.",3,2025-05-21 16:22:34
"Game has kept me interested for a few years. Only major negative is that it's a money pit. Updates are usually amazing. Boat race sucked at first nI still hate being limited to one play every 24 hrs for the clan. Just when I'm getting bored, they update, bring a new card, and change things up. There's a reason this game has been around so long. It's because they never stop working on it. They're never content and always changing with player feedback. It's that dedication that keeps it awesome.",4,2021-06-07 19:20:54
"Be warned. This game heavily involves either countering or being countered by the enemy. Rarely does this game involve a proper fair 1v1 scenario. I have played this game for over a year now and the only reason i am still playing is because of the time i have invested into it. I do not recommend spending money onto this game since most of the deals are just overpriced. However, I do enjoy the variety of different characters that are available to choose from aswell as the war day gamemode.",2,2019-01-09 21:06:49
"This season's update has ruined the game. Since the price hike a while back on the ""Premium"" pass, everything is so pay to play here. Yes, everything is eventually obtainable, but you need to grind for years to get up to level 15. The current season, though, has really made horrible changes to the game. Pretty much less of everything that was in the pass before. The only update they should have given was unlocking your earned chest instantly. Make an OG season pass, and go back.",2,2025-04-19 01:29:24
"There's to much parity in the game. Players use the easiest, cheapest cards and spam them and there's nothing you can do about it. It makes the game repetitive and boring. The paywalls are also absolutely absurd. Supercell tries so hard to get youre money rather than make the game more enjoyable. I've played this game on and off for about 7 years and it has gone downhill because of the repetitive game play.",1,2025-01-16 01:54:13
"I've been playing this game since the year it came out. Sometimes in the past, they introduced shards. These let your character be more elite. Little did I know this was just a way to benefit to pay-to-play players. After what feels like a year of the shards being released, ice earned a grand total of 2 of them. They developers have found a way to advantage paying players while holding non paying ones down. I'm about done.",2,2024-10-04 18:23:38
"Wow, this update... I've been playing CR since almost the very beginning, and I've seen it grow from the basic 1v1, to Clan Wars, to Pay-per-season, etc. I understood supporting the developers with the $5.99, but now for the same exact thing they're asking $11.99? Really? I've been paying the $5.99 a month, but this seems very greedy and I'm very close to Uninstalling the game and finding something else to give my time and money to. More than double for the same thing... disappointing.",2,2023-04-03 16:38:14
"Update - now it's even more obvious that paying players are given the advantage. Meeting same or lower level opponents with higher level cards all the time. Additionally, strange things are happening to save opponents when they are losing. Google should take this game out of the store and review what is going on, fewls like a complete scam now. Pay to win. If you don't pay you will not get ANY good cards. The paying players have an edge that is impossible to handle if you don't pay.",1,2019-07-18 02:47:44
"Every update makes the game worse. What used to be a game of strategy has become a game with no skill due to the inclusion of evolutions. Furthermore, every update makes progression more difficult unless you spend a large amount of money. Do not download this app. They do not care about the player experience only about money. And as with my experience, it has only gotten less fun throughout the years and is now unplayable.",1,2025-04-26 22:10:53
"Game was a lot of fun for years. Then came tencent. Since they purchased Supercell, it's been downhill fast. This latest champions update with level 14 was the last straw for me. Just another in a long series of attempts to get their greedy fingers on my wallet. Playing War Alliance now. It's actually fun. Thanks for ruining a once great game.",1,2021-11-16 17:33:38
"It's really hard to make progress, even if you buy the gold pass, which was nerfed severely in the latest update. Plus, the amount of grind for high level cards increased drastically with the introduction of level 15. This makes it difficult even for paid players to achieve maxed decks, and completely annihilates the already slow progress of the free-to-play. It's now the biggest grind since DS3 single player covenant farming. Or, you could shell over hundreds of dollars to speed things up.",1,2023-04-08 09:13:28
"Clash Royale used to be one of my favorite games. The strategy provided interesting gameplay, the progression was fun, and you felt accomplished. However, as of late, it seems that the dev team is making the WORST possible choice with every update. Evolutions were broken for almost their entire lifetime and continue to be troublesome, limited modes and challenges are less fun, clan war is uninteresting, and now progression has been MURDERED. I don't understand why these things had to happen.",1,2025-04-03 04:04:29
"It's been fun playing this game. I've made friends over it, had fun with it, and enjoyed playing it casually. That said, I can't honestly say it's fun to play anymore. Between the major battle pass (season pass) nerf and it's increased price, and this absurd, unbalanced, lazy, and free2play punishing excuse for an update, I can definitively say that both playing the game casually, and spending money on it in any way is barely to not worth it anymore. Sad supercell, you ruined something great",1,2023-06-24 21:30:38
"Latest update is broken and hangs on startup while showing ""Account alert"" dialog. The review below is for older version of this game. Probably the best game created by Supercell. I think it's not worth using real money because early stages are the best part of the game and that's the part that you can skip with little real world money. The resources you get in the game grow linearly but the prices go up exponentially. Expect to pay hundreds of dollars if you want top cards with shortcuts...",1,2024-03-19 14:37:45
"Overall the game is fun, the new updates seem to correct some of the errors from the previous release. We are probably still stuck being beat by the exact same clans for a month. Magic items help lvl cards... which is good but makes it quicker to get a brand new card maxed, which makes the fun of getting specific cards less appealing. If you have all cards maxed on a specific tier, you cant request cards of that type, but you should be able to request ANY card due to needing star points.",3,2021-06-08 10:14:18
"This new update is a scam! Just right when the game was finally improving and they do this to us. The apology is a good start, but doesn't change the fact that we have no gold left to upgrade our cards. This game need to give us more gold, and not 750 gold limit per day. Also, you need to add a way to opt out players that don't attack in clan wars. This game has too many issues already and you guys aren't solving them, instead you keep adding more and more problem to the game. #NoLvl14",1,2021-10-25 15:55:28
"Used to love this game, started playing with guys from work several years ago when the game was still fresh. The new war mode, however, was, by far, the worst update to the game, and I've noticed a steep drop-off in players who haven't already been playing for a long time. The war is only fun if you have a large, full clan of nothing but very active players, which causes infighting. If you have a smaller clan, get used to seeing that stupid boot every week!",2,2021-06-07 21:10:55
"Finally uninstalled this game. After multiple years of trying to make it work, I'm done. The pay to win aspects are just too egregious. If you don't shell out ALOT of money, you simply can't be competitive. This ""game"" is fine at the lower ranks, but as you progress you get to a point where it's more about who has spent the most money and not who's the better player. I will never support another Supercell game. Don't waste your time on their games, unless you plan on spending thousands.",1,2021-12-30 17:36:42

"Been playing this game in 2017, I have some issues and problems, problem 1: matchmaking, sometimes I get paired with the player 2 levels over me or even under me. (to be completely fair) problem 2: You literally need to play this game every single day to gain a lot of experience which takes forever to level up when your level 7-8 and higher. Problem 3: Its pretty pay to win. If you ran out of money, you will either pay with gems or real money which grinding players find it annoying. That's all.",4,2021-01-17 10:51:26
"This game is well ,how should I say this without being rude ,not in its best ,but it is worthy a try. I mean ,it could be better but I still like spending my free time trying to beat other players. It has its problems though ,like for example , you are a low level player and when you decide to play duel , you play with a very strategic player in which is nothing compared to you or its lags that may bug your experience in the game , despite all those issues , I will give this game three stars. ★★★",3,2019-08-06 04:00:40
"Writing this review with first hand experience, this game is not worth trying now , it has lot of unwanted new things which makes it extremely hard for free to play players , if you have ample money to spend on game go for it rest can avoid. This is the kind of game where climbing the leaderboard doesn't depend on your skills but the amount of money you have to spend on this stupid game",1,2025-01-21 15:56:59
"Downloaded the game at launch and played fairly consistently since with only a few breaks. Loved this game, but the current pay-to-play system with level 15 cards and evolutions is ridiculous. Supercell has ruined their game and turned it the most disappointing money pit. I'm by no means against a company monetizing their game, and have in fact spent a fair amount of money on Clash Royale. But the newest update is nothing short of pay-to-play. I don't know if I'll ever play this game again. 0/5",1,2023-09-04 12:12:32
"Legendary cards are not worth nearly what they are priced in shop. 40k for an ice wizard? Ludicrous. The lumberjack is a great example of a good legendary card. Fast, but can only attack 1 target at a time; upon death, however, he drops rage, which is very useful for support style cards, like anti-air. I do LOVE this game, and that's why I want to see it get even better. A few balancing changes and thus would be golden. Btw, I do LOVE the change you made with micro-transactions, as it does seem worth it to pay for chests that have special attributes like picking your own cards or striking out ones you may not want. I love this game and just want to see it go in a positive way.",3,2018-12-06 06:53:01
"I've enjoyed this game for years and years, and while, yes, they've increased the amount of monetary options for purchase, my main complaint at the moment is the ""Skibidi"" advertisement that has been circulating. I already have the app on my phone and I keep blocking and disliking the ad. The ad keeps reappearing without the dislike, being a new unblocked instance of the ad.

"The game used to be good: You get chests, up your card levels, enjoy and that's it. Now it has SO MANY things you need to pay LOADS of money to be able to level up properly and ""enjoy"" the game for five minutes. It's just a cash grab at this point. Now it's not about who has better strategy, it's about who has more money into their accounts. Absolutely ridiculous. If you want to burn some cash, this game is what you're looking for.",1,2024-01-02 05:55:51
"The game was fun when it came out, but slowly over the years Supercell has changed what made the game good. It's so bad it's possible to softlock progression at the very start of the game. This review isn't so change can happen. it's to bring down the overall rating in a collective group effort. I would have choice words for you, Supercell but then you have a valid reason to take this down. I'm simply upset. That is all. Thank you.",1,2025-06-08 12:58:49
"This was a pretty neat game, I've been playing since late 2016. I loved clash, but they're killing their player base with all these horrible updates. With lvl 15, the game will be less fun for all of the f2p player's because they don't wanna spend money to progress in a game that claims to be free. I also hate how they did the different game modes. I think the season shop is alright, but the fact that we don't get crowns for it is absolute bs.",1,2023-04-13 23:20:44
"I've been playing this game for nearly a decade now and the most recent update has made me stop playing. I didn't love how long chests would take and progression felt painfully slow for years but with daily lucky drops, the battle pass, and the season shop. It felt faster then ever. That is, until they cut the battle pass rewards in half, got rid of chests and the season shop and changed the daily rewards. I have played this game for a long time, but this was the final straw for me. I give up.",1,2025-04-20 19:59:49
"Great game, but Supercell has many issues with it they need to fix: 1. In-game payments blasting everywhere 2. (If competitive) rather unbalanced 3. Mid-ladder is very toxic (this is a player base problem, not a Supercell problem) 4. Can become very dull when Supercell doesn't continuously add new changes and cards",3,2025-11-24 02:31:06
"This game can be fun, but will likely end up being frustratingly painful for many. The truth is the game requires tons of work to be put in as you will need to level up your cards, your tower, and work quite a bit to get enjoyment out of the game. But even despite putting all the work in, this game is plagued with many issues: certain deck combos being favorable, some cards being a bit too strong, being part of a clan, and the level gap making many games unfair or screwed. Good Luck.",3,2020-05-08 17:14:35
"It used to be a great game, but got pay to win in recent years. But I can look past that, whatever you need to do to keep up sales I guess. But let me spin you a tale of horrid customer service. Ive had an account pretty much since launch, but lost it because I deleted the email account linked to the supercell ID when I was inactive for a long time. While trying to recover the account, I've given details only the account holder would know, but was banned for 31 days. Seven times.",1,2023-02-04 09:18:20
"I had a good review up for years, but this game is now a shadow of what it once was. last few updates murdered progression, rewards, and even the audio is now butchered. This newest update has changed/destroyed the foundation of a nearly 10 year old game, and the few remaining non-pay-to-win aspects are completely gone. thanks for that. and also thanks for automatically opening the 8 year old chest I had saved since Arena 4. this game is unplayable.",1,2025-04-08 02:53:33

Playing this game without spending a ton of money is just feeding the players that actually have paid an insane amount. I've spent money on the pass, and bundles from time to time; without a consistent investment, you are nothing.",1,2024-09-19 00:22:05

When you play no clan bot, they always have exactly the right characters to beat you, and you can tell they get the potion so much faster than you can.

So unless you're spending money, then you can't advance fast.",1,2025-04-02 05:16:37
"I used to think this game was great, but honestly by this point it's the worst money grab I've ever seen on Google Play store. They make you think you're strong, then the matchmaking throws you against near impossible opponents, making you feel the need to spend money in order to keep playing and progressing. And when you do, the matchmaking somehow gets worse and you don't see any progression.

"Clash is fun, and very easy to load up and kill 5-10 minutes multiple times a day. I've been a true free-to-play for over 3 years, so you absolutely CAN compete and have fun while not spending money. However, this is very much a pay-to-win game.

"At first I thought this game is gonna be at least alright in terms of strategy but it turns out that if you don't have the card, no matter what strategy you use, you are destined to loose the game. Specific cards like Baby Dragon, Skeleton Army, and etc are cards that will give you a really high advantage which in turn guarantees your opponent's loss. Also, the card selection just sucks.

The design is awful to navigate. £10 for a single level up from lvl14 - 15, there's literally 100+ cards. Making maxing everything will cost you at least a £1000. It's impossible with f2p.

I thought the level 15 update would be the worst they've ever conceived, but they truly put their full wits and will together and went out of their way to compose the worst update by far. I had already given up on the game a bit ago, but even hearing about this update drove me to the point of even having it on my phone. I've been dedicated to the game for quite some time, reaching GM and such. The game has had a good run, but as all things do, it has truly died",1,2025-04-10 06:36:20
"I used to enjoy this game quite a lot back in the day, but since then, it has fallen further and further downwards due to becoming increasingly pay to win. The latest update especially is probably the worst one in its lifetime. Level 15 is almost entirely a cashgrab due to the ridiculous amount of time and money required to fully max out and even Evolutions,which was an interesting mechanic, has been monetized by Supercell. Do not play this game if you value your time and money.",1,2023-06-21 13:49:46
it was a really good game early on but as days went by my experience just went downhill till arena 10 it was okay but in the legendary arena all i face is level 14 enemies and the meta keeps on changing and my cards being level 10 or 11. now it is just a pay to win game and nothing much is left of it,1,2025-11-24 18:58:27
"It's a fantastic game it's one of the most fun games I've played in a while, but it does take skill, and there r a lot of people that r pay 2 win, but overall it's a great game. I wish u could remove shards from one card and give it to another card",4,2025-11-10 11:58:07
"Corporate Greed!!! The game is fun and has been on a balancing rope with the different cards in the meta. The new cards however change this completely alongside the new level. Rewards have also been nerfed, the gap between F2P and P2W widens. I hate this, alongside the other gamebreaking mechanics.",2,2025-11-25 12:34:58
"Eh what can I say that hasn't already been said for the many games that are just like this? You fight PvP, join a group and use a 'wars' mechanic. There's a premium pass you pay for that gets you better loot and skins, and it's a free game so wait timers are its bread and butter. This one has cards you collect to level up troops, which isn't original but is at least interesting- I can at least see why some people buy the premium currency. Overall okay but I wouldn't waste money on it.",3,2021-08-09 08:35:49
"The issue is as many have mentioned that the beginning is very enjoyable up until you have spent enough time to be hooked at the game. At which point ""matchmaking"" only ever puts you against players that have a perfect counter deck, or are completely maxed out, in other words telling you ""you can be that good too just buy them chests so you can get maxed out too"" as getting chests the free to play way is incredibly slow. Conceptually I love the game, but supercell is worse than EA as a company.",1,2020-03-25 01:56:53

"I wish players would be able to unselect a card during a match because I have accidentally deployed a fireball in the very corner of the screen. I accidentally tapped the area with the corner of my hand. I've seen other players I'm competing against doing the same thing I just mentioned as well. It's an easy fix. cmon, supercell!",4,2025-09-05 16:28:47
"I was a clash Royale player then took a break. I came back a to play couple of months ago and they have made it pay to win. If you pay, you get more evos and that is enough to win. There is no balance between the different cards. I have one car that has an attack speed of 1.6 seconds but a card that cost 2 more elixer has the same speed and 3x the health and does area damage and can jump in the air and cause more damage. It keeps getting infuriating to play with the meta builds everyone uses",1,2026-02-11 00:07:19
"P2w experience, the only way to win is with the ultimate debit card 0.0 cycle. No canon for that.",1,2025-12-21 09:30:14
"it's fun at first then they only put you against the same type of deck to force a loss, I fought the same deck with just three characters changed about 12 times in a row, I still won some but fighting the same deck everytime is tiring and needs to change.",1,2025-10-26 21:19:03
So the game is amazing. Graphics are great cards nice and easy to drag around the field. But lately I have been having some problems. When I try to join the Modern Day Challenge or something like that the percentage goes up slowly and when it hits 100 it crashes and when I click on Clash Royale it crashes. So I have to restart the app every time I want to go back but still cannot join a game. Overall a very good app,4,2019-08-05 14:42:52
"very fun, especially with friends who play the game even if it's just for a bit. gotta try it at least once and dont give up after a few times of losing, it's all about strategy and once you get the hang of it you'll have lots of fun even if you lose. Update: became very pay to win I feel. I haven't spent a lot of money on this {maybe like twenty dollars} game. I've noticed you just get stuck at a specific rank if you don't get lucky/specific draws from the chests or pay for cards.",2,2023-12-07 13:47:01
"So this game is decent. No doubt about that. The concept is great. But the game is becoming predictable and repetitive. Everybody uses the same things. My Wi-Fi is usually stable, but still has a chance of lagging. If only the game would pause if disconnected. A great feature you can hopefully add. There are flaws to this though. Players in a losing side might just disconnect and connect to stall. Maybe you can only lag out twice before they cannot use it anymore. Consider please.",3,2019-12-08 11:48:32
"I used to love this game. I even used watched content creaters. But it seems now everything is just a mess. They've added way too much. They need to simplify the menus, mechanics, and UI, it's full of noise and ugly. The problem is that this game makes drastic changes and doesn't look back. It started to go downhill after they changed wars. There is definitely sense of pay to win going on now and battle pass cost more now, forget that nonsense. Gut the game, more does not mean better. Daunting.",2,2023-06-16 08:23:47
"Its a fun game, with a simple concept, three towers, attack and defend. The better you become however, the more you're punished. A good example, if youre level 11 they will constantly put you against a level 13. Also, the constant re-balancing of the cards is really irritating. Unfortunately the developers have become VERY money hungry and have released season passes. No reason to stick around anymore. Tried game again, still garbage.",1,2023-03-26 01:15:39
"A great game for wealthy gamers! The gameplay is fun, and there's lots of strategy options. Plus, with the ability to dump money into the game to try to unlock stronger units or upgrade the ones you have, there are endless spending opportunities! Who can turn down the offer to max out a specific card until the end of the season? Anyways, I left it with 2 stars because the gameplay is actually fun, but if you're not willing to pay, don't expect to win. Uninstalled.",2,2022-01-05 04:23:36
"My most played mobile game. i love that it doesnt prevent you from playing with a stupid energy system, and i love the balance between precise timing or positioning, and sparce player input. great strategy game, but tailored for mobile. The thing i hate about it is the leveling system. im ok with unlocking cards but leveling up causes a lot of frustration as you are put against level max players. Edit: Very detrimental updates as of late. Unfortunate design is making the game worse for everyone.",3,2023-05-18 22:48:53
"I started playing because my kids were always ""Clashing"" and talking about the grind. It is fun but the software needs some work. Frequently freezes, drops WIFI or 5G internet, and/or stores the moves and when it catches up the opponent play is accelerated. The algorithm doesn't account for card level so there are matches where you are, or can be hopelessly overmatched. I like that it can be picked up for a quick game but the frequent drops and slow rewards don't make it a long term play.",2,2021-07-23 01:15:08
"The graphics are great, and the gameplay is entertaining and interesting. Sometimes the controls will slip up for me but overall it's a very well made game that's free to play, and quite easy without paying. However, the new pass royale seems a bit much, it's not really necessary and it's just another ripoff of the epic games strategy to make more money.",5,2019-07-02 09:49:49
"Bad updates make games go into the forgotten apps or just uninstall them. This used to be an average game with a lot of potential. A lot of recent changes helped close the gap between whales and new players. The season pass was accessible for everyone who had time to play casually. The last update of April, changed everything for worse. Now the season pass can't be finished by playing casual, and ranked uses a mode that isn't for everyone, making it harder to climb. It's time to move on...",1,2023-04-18 20:12:01
"Liking it a lot so far! No need to wait for resources to upgrade buildings or create troops; just go and attack opponents straight away. Real time and exciting. Edit after 3 days of playing: the chests take so long to open, you can open only one at a time, and there are only 4 slots for the chests. After filling these 4 slots, playing a match doesn't give you anything except trophies. So in the end you can play only a few matches each DAY (which can make you progress in game) which is really disa",3,2019-01-28 21:25:22
"Really fun game, even though sometimes it feels like the games makes you keep getting counters to your decks. Though the reason it's 4 star is because i've been disconnecting every single game at least once, sometimes more. And it has made me lose so many games from disconnecting for even just 5 seconds. Please fix this problem, it only happens eith clash royale.",4,2025-09-04 21:27:42
Worst game of all time. I thought Supercell were fighting toxicity but they became so greedy that they brang back the emote that they removed because it was to toxic but they brang it back for 6 euros. Secondly you can't progress withour buying stuff in the game. Most of the players can't play ranked which means no elite cards which means no lvl 15 cards. It takes for F2P players 3 months to get evo for free which i think is ridiciolus. And i can't play comp cuz im lvl 14 tower and cardsveryhard,1,2025-09-03 21:36:48
"The most recent upgrade made the 2v2 games unplayable. Not sure if it has opened up cheating, if they've increased the difficulty of the bots, or of they're just pairing players inappropriately, but the game is now unwinnable. It's taken all the fun out of it, dozens and dozens of games lost in a row, with no chance of winning. Even if you're close, something will happen to force a loss - your partner will drop, lag will occur, or your opponent suddenly has 30 mana to use. It's become a joke.",1,2019-10-06 19:22:48
"Great game at the start... wasn't long before i got to a point were i would be faced with opponents who's deck just dwarfed my own. At that point there was no possibility to make progress. I had reached my peak and for the next 3 seaseons, reset after reset, i was met with matches that were impossible to win. From there all i saw was a loss in progress, the more i tried to reach were i once was, the harder it became. The game is set up for you to play for years but never reach your goal.

"This is a great game! The gameplay is great and doesn't get old, the graphics are simple yet great, and generally a great game. As much as I'd love to give this app a five star review, recently since the new update my game crashes on the loading screen. I get that things like this happen but I can't help but feel annoyed, as I am now going to be kicked from my clan for missing war. Anyways, great game, just please fix this issue.",4,2019-07-03 10:37:10
"Terrible. It's a fun game at first but developers straight up got lazy with the game after some time. The same passion and energy that was put into the game is gone. Nothing but recycled seasons, and royale passes (battle pass). Game is extremely boring, and caters towards those who pay up. The new clan wars 2 feature; only real way to win is to have higher leveled cards, which you can pay to level up(optional). Good luck trying to get max cards without paying, so far it's taken me 4 years. FUSC",1,2020-10-16 04:29:44
"One of the best designed games on the play store. Good graphics, responsive controls, fun game concept... but the ones who contribute (with real money) had more chances to win. Because of that if you don't want to contribute, eventually, you'll get frustrated with the game. Despite of that, is a really fun game that can be enjoyed for free (only an account is required in order to get some data of you).",4,2019-06-30 19:15:03
"Brilliant game, wonderful concept, great graphics! Unfortunately recent introductions of new cards have disturbed the balances of the game to the point where it isn't fun to play any longer. There isn't skill involved any more it is pure luck! Unfortunately the developers have decided to make money. With the most recent update the regeneration rate of players that spend money is much faster. The rate is supposed to be 1 per second, mine is close to 1 per 2 seconds, because i spend no money!$hame",1,2020-01-22 20:20:14
"This game is wonderful as it is easy to learn how to play but also very strategic. However, it is the matchmaking system that makes you pissed off. After winning some easy matches, you ALWAYS confront hard counters CONSECUTIVELY for quite a lot of time. I am sure it is not random but the system tries to manipulate your win rate - in a flimsy way. At first, losing streak made me play more aggressively, but as it repeats continuesly, now I just quit the app and play infrequently.",2,2020-04-27 08:33:13
"The game is fun for a while, but there really is a cap unless you spend money. Point and case, youtube lvl 1's 3 crowning everyone. They may not admit to it but there is a balance problem that becomes very apparent when you climb the ladder. i get it, they need to make money too, but i can't spend any more money on this game. the game glitches and crashes at random intervals. the balance is iffy. Tried again, 1 week uninstalled. Game got better after I spend $10, then back to trash.",2,2023-04-16 19:57:39
The game is really fun. But i hate that the game decides when you win or lose. You can play against someone lower or equal to your level in the first battle then the next will be someone stronger so you can win and lose. Also in the chest they don't possess new troops most times so you have to work with the little troops you have and you have to battle against someone with all the troops available for that level.,3,2022-05-03 14:34:25
"It's a good fun game, fun art style and great tactical depth. I understand the need for in-app purchases fully, but this game really throws them down your throat at every opportunity and there's little in the way of safety net to stop you getting utterly trounced purely because you only paid $20 and the other guy paid $200. Really enjoying the game but there are more ""balanced"" experiences out there.",3,2018-12-05 19:48:48
"The game crashes every time I try to enter the marketplace tab. Quite convenient timing for such a bug to pop up, since they're offering free stuff there that is no longer accessible because the game crashes every time you try to get to it. Additionally, the matchmaking is awful. I'm always paired with someone at least a level below me, and even when playing super old decks, I still win because of the gap. Buggy and blatantly unfair to its players.",2,2019-07-04 09:28:22
"When Clash Royale first came out, I absolutely loved it. I just couldn't stop playing it and it was all fun. But now I have faced a serious problem with this game. I have managed to reach 5000+ trophies with mostly lvl 11 and some lvl 12 cards but now I just face people with maxed lvl cards which are quite hard to beat. Even upgrading a single card takes months and a lot of time. The main issue is at this point I'm just stuck and there's nothing I can do about it(frustrating).",2,2020-01-17 12:48:56

But since the last update the slow creap of pay to win took a massive leap forward, so much so that players 3 levels below me had a full set of maxed cards.

"This game would be so much better if the pairing system actually worked, since I can't beat a single person, and randomly fighting in stages 6-9 levels higher than mine, and if there was something to prevent your stupid partner not doing anything and basically abandoning you, like a auto placing, I guess, that took the first troop card and put it on the battle Feild if all were charged and five seconds have gone by after none have been touched. Just an idea, tho. It would make the game much better",3,2018-11-20 05:23:50

Sure, you can spend money to speed up the process of crafting your perfect deck.. but that's every collecting card game in a nutshell. With its simplicity, this game gives players the ability to tune their own strategies, with a healthy meta of decks that all have their strengths and weaknesses. The deck size is a bit small for a card game, but I think that just adds to the strategy of choosing combos vs tech cards carefully.",4,2020-04-19 18:44:02

However, after gaining a certain amount of trophies, you reach a point where your cards are 2-4 levels below everyone else's, so you constantly lose. You aren't rewarded with gold to level up your troops if you lose, and you can't drop trophies (to play people at your level) if you lose either, so you're stuck. Then it becomes a grind to get wins and gold to level up your cards. When you reach this point the game isn't fun anymore.",2,2022-05-30 09:56:46

"Used to be a huge fan of the game but now I feel like they have tried to make everyone happy and have rigged the game in the process. (Update) It seems that party mode is gone. For those unfamiliar with the game, that's the mode that you can 2v2 with friends and gain chests without losing trophies. Also matching should not be based on trophies alone but instead use both trophies and average card level",2,2023-04-02 21:21:40
"Incredibly good, interesting, fun and balanced game but the company has become increasingly greedier. The most recent update gutted the progression for casual players, forcing them to play the main competitive mode if they want any rewards at all for playing. Along with the same update reducing rewards from the battle pass and challenges, makes for a very poor experience. I would absolutely recommend playing this a year ago, but now I would recomend staying away from it.",1,2023-03-31 23:02:59

The pass also costs $1 more and gives less, while having an option that gives the same as the old pass, but for $12. A $7 increase!",1,2023-03-29 09:27:19
"Fast, fun, and competitive game play. Easy to get hooked once you give it a try, but then there are the downsides. The lag in matches have gotten a lot worst, you can load into a match late at no fault of your own; have an up to date device, a strong stable Wi-Fi, and enough free memory will not save you from it. For a game that supposed to be competitive, how can you market this for an esport when you can load in 10sec or more late?",2,2019-10-09 13:23:35

The game is practically perfect except for the fact that you have to wait 3 Hours if not more for a better chest. Even when I'm full, I play cause it's that addicting but I'm not making any progress.

Don't spend money on it, I made that mistake with a single $10 purchase to try to get back into it, because when I had fun; it was amazing. However what really did it in for me was the lack of variety this game has; EVERY PLAYER without fail uses the same deck, so it is literally the same battle everytime you play.

to suggest one thing, hear me out. When the internet connection times out

you just automatically pause the game for 5 seconds to give time for the 
reconnection. If 5 seconds passed and the player didn't reconnect then 
automatically resume the game.",1,2020-08-21 01:45:18
Yea I have to agree this thing becomes rigged and almost unplayable when you get to the league arenas if you're not paying out of pocket for upgrades. Matches are so uneven ( lvl 9 vs lvl 13 max). Then they toss in a freebie here and there for you to win. Literally the other player doesn't even attack at all. So weird. Started off as something great though but just have to let go when start to see what's going on..shame.,2,2019-09-29 12:50:34
"It was a decent game but recent updates made the gameplay more grind-ish and annoying overall, with several heavy penalizations to the players' progress both for pay-to-win and, specially, free-to-play ones. It is clear that the care that was put to get the game where it is is long gone and is no longer worth playing unless you want to spend a good chunk of money to get somewhere in a reasonable amount of time. Would recommend it two years ago, but now I honestly can no longer do that.",1,2023-06-21 05:40:26
"Just uninstalled the app, there's something wrong with the algorythm. Sometimes when you use the characters, instead of taking the left they take the right. You may be winning and all of a sudden the character goes the wrong path. Other times it doesnt matter what you do, even having cards with a higher level the opponent defeats you, or takes time for the character to show up having full elixir.",3,2020-02-17 14:05:13
The game is great. A great strategy game that you have to have a chess mind for. Also the challenges and team games are fun. There is a bit of pay to win elements though. Also I have uninstalled a couple of times because of the game changing my cards. It is rare but it is frustrating during matches. Other than that the game is pretty good. If the pay to play and glitches were smoothed out then I would give 5 stars.,3,2021-08-02 23:00:11
"I like the game so much not until when Im getting a winning streak, the opponent will get stronger, like my tower is just level 10 and most of my opponents are in level 11 and 12, sometimes it's level 13 towers. In addition, I have a good internet connection then suddenly the game will slow down, lagging the game and opponents winning. Kindly fix this..and those hackers. Thanks!",3,2019-01-28 21:16:45
"At this point, clash Royale has become a pay to win game. I loved this game so much because it was truly one of a kind. But now, with evolutions, wild cards etc it's extremely hard to farm gold and gems and waiting to get them takes too long. With crazy prices for deals in the shop really not many ppl can afford to call this game ""casual"" anymore. Game used to be a stress reliever for me, but every time I play chances are 2 out of 4 times I am matched with a maxed out player with 2 evolutions.",1,2024-03-15 19:06:38
"Update*: Now the connection is stable and very good to play, rarely drops connection. -- In the past was very good, but now I don't now what happened, the connection to start the battle freeze in the loading area, and when enter in the game is already over(Is frustrating lose the war battle in this way, I've played 3 battles collecting card before for nothing ) my internet is very good and this isn't the problem",4,2019-11-27 21:30:21
"The game is no doubt good. There's a lot of possibilities when it comes to future development. Mechanics, features and all (elemental advantages, spell defense, structure-unit interaction) . Things I wish were better: I hate that teammates can bail out on you in a 2v2. Consecutive games like that can get frustrating. I also wish there were more communication options. Strategizing messages, co-op, etc. Personally I even want a message for when teammates leave matches. Also crown tower growth 😬",4,2021-12-30 06:13:54
"The game is pretty straight forward and would be a lot of fun if it wasn't a pay to win game. Unless you drop loads of cash to max out your cards, you'll get stuck in middling levels forever. Which means no new cards for a very long time. Events would be a cool alternative but that gets expensive too if you ever want to win there. And the 2v2? It's horribly random.",2,2018-09-27 00:42:14
"The levelling system is garbage at higher levels. The gameplay in the beginning is great, but at later arenas, it gets so hard to find people your level, but instead, they hand you people level 11 and 10 despite you being level 9. And BTW, you level up by leveling up cards, so you know they're cards are way stronger. I'd be fine if the fights were with equal level players, but I'd rather not play if I get in multiple fights in a row against high level people that I know I can't beat.",3,2021-03-18 18:38:51
"Good game but the way how they manage updates and introduce new features were horrible.1. There were too many bugs. At least one disconnection around 15 battles. I had to quickly close and re-enter the game to salvage it mostly ended in a lost. 2. Wanted to sent message to supercell by last time they didnt bother to respond so there is no need for me to do that. 3. Slow compare to the first year of release. Slow load, slow game play. Slow in fixing bugs. Sometimes spawning takes 2 to 3 secs.....",1,2020-05-29 11:07:58
"Used to enjoy the game, but got really frustrated with the constant push to buy passes. It became nearly impossible to grind out upgrades. The menus are so confusing, there is so much happening, as a casual gamer, it makes it extremely difficult to just log in play a few games and then wait for chests. It seems if you are not on this game all the time, you are missing out on so much. It is like going on holiday during peak times, still enjoyable but you need a holiday once you return. Exhausting",2,2023-06-20 06:12:53
"Fun game to play but every now and then some problems pop up that wont go away. Game keeps getting stuck while opening chests. Game abruptly restarts during intense matches at times. Some buildings lag when putting it into position even a half second lag can net you a loss. One major problems is the teammates the game ""randomly chooses"" I can lose 20 matches in a row while playing with a game selected teammate and can only seem to break the streak when I play 1vs1. This happens all the time.",1,2020-05-22 13:28:57
"The game is quick and fun, you need to use strategy and you'll battle many different kinds of people. I wish the company would upgrade their servers tho, because sometimes you get disconnected in the middle of a battle. Sometimes it's only once, other times it's incessant. Currently, the game won't open properly. When trying to login, the game informs me that there's an update and brings me to play store, but there's no update to install. I tried the uninstall/ reinstall method, same thing.",4,2019-01-28 20:31:35
"Was originally a five star a couple years ago, now, as everyone states, it is severely a pay to win deal. I get when some skill can come into play, but now it is simply just pay to wins and bad luck. I don't mind when money is spent on a game, but don't make it to where it ruins the experience for everyone. Most of the time I am always countered by cards that are higher leveled than me, and not by a small amount mind you, by a few levels and ""stars"" at that.",1,2023-11-16 01:56:56
"Still fun, but used to be a lot more simple and straightforward... they keep demotivating the long time players by making it easier and easier to obtain stuff. We spent the time building up to what we have, and it feels so unfair that the new players just can come in and collect gold and level up their decks in such short time. The game felt more fair prior in this regard.",4,2021-10-27 17:12:28
"Addictive and fun, sometimes it can seem rigged, but the fan base is huge and for that they have a very active staff constantly changing the game to balance power and fix any issues that may pop up. there are tons of YouTube videos as well. I've had this game for 2 years now with no plans on uninstalling, and I've barely put any cash into it whatsoever yet I'm a single level/arena away from the world tournaments. it's just a great strategy game.",4,2019-01-28 22:29:29
"I started playing again after a long time since I got busy with college. When I tried to update my game it just gets stuck halfway (in game update) and after a while I get prompted to restart the game. This issue is stuck in a loop and I tried to clear cache and data, as well as reinstalling the game (twice!) Even as I start making this review I encounter a ton of other reviews about Clash Royale becoming a P2W game. I'm suddenly unsure if I want to play this game again.",1,2021-12-08 00:12:19
"The game is awesome! I've been following it and waiting for it to release ever since Supercell did a beta of it. It's awesome, and easy to learn! (Edit); Although the game isn't necessarily ""Pay 2 Win"", it's definitely like Clash of Clans, in the sense that it's ""Pay 2 Progress (Faster)"". You can easily play the game without paying a single cent and get to the higher arena levels, but it'll most likely take a long time. The game also has /slight/ balancing issues, but supercell tries to resolve t",4,2019-01-28 20:38:57
"It's funny for a while. However, if you want to get serious it becomes an annoying money grab. The game seems to intentionally put you against maxed/over leveled players and expects you to be able to win. The concept is nice but the environment made the game not fun! Eventually the game became not worth the time or grind! Play the game knowing it'll be fun in the beginning, but you'll have to invest heavy or you won't be able to go against other people you face!",1,2020-04-14 12:03:39
"Fun while it lasted but it feels annoying and complicated trying to get back to playing... They realized how long it took to level up and now there's a bunch of systems and nonsense hoops to go through, I literally uninstalled it instead since I am not trying to learn new systems or prize tracks. Gamers just want to play and stay at the top, why so much need for new systems, money?! Nostalgia turned to annoyance, I respect that it was once really fun so I couldn't leave it at one star.",2,2022-12-05 11:29:26
"I love the game and there is always something to do but I feel I've lost the insetive to play. Mainly because progression has slowed down at you get closer to max and the level curve is an issue. But the game is great. Personally the biggest issue is replay ability, the core game play of ladder is stale. And the progression. Attempting to funnel resources to your fav one deck is difficult,time consuming, feels like an impossible task and detrimental to other modes like clan wars.",4,2022-08-09 17:18:10
"Encompassing strategy, player wit, and utilization of over 96 playable cards and millions of deck creation opportunity, the game opens up many options and holds very little restriction to what agency the player can have, despite meta decks being a problem or the occassional balancing issue, but is to be expected. Although the game can be won without the use of in-game purchases, it will take more chances than not to make you want to with special chests, gold, and gems, but gameplay is managable.",4,2019-10-03 12:26:35
"Used to love this game, and played it a ton and had fond memories. But over the years monetization and unnecessary, money driven changes grew and grew, and have culminated in the past months being despicable when it comes to free vs paid experiences. Do yourself a big favor and steer wide clear of this game in the modern era. It's only going downhill.",1,2023-03-30 17:49:54
It could definiteley be a good game if it didn't stop and close itself every three seconds and if instead of constantly saying there is no signal when I get three bars with LTE and also when I go and play a 2v2 it closes and when I go and open it up again it loads up to 50% and re-loads without fail every time not allowing me to even enter the game. Not too much has changed since I played it a while ago in terms of connection.,1,2019-05-30 04:27:29
The game has seemed to take a turn for the worse. I deal with so much latency (mainly during the challenges and war) that it makes it extremely difficult staying competitive. Most of the time is like the elixer never comes while the opponent drops and endless barrage of troops. Then the get speeds up and I'm dead all before I can drop a single card. It was fun while it lasted.,2,2020-03-23 01:39:28
"Everything is great. I love this game. It has evolved so much than before. Just one issue though. For some reason, the tips that are shown at the matchmaking screen are not completely visible. They are so far down the screen that their cut in half and i can't even read them. I wish i could put screenshots here but i can. But otherwise this game is good",4,2022-03-16 22:58:22
"Dev team could really step it up a bit more in update frequency. They still need to fix problems in the game such as trading, which is slow to update. These 'offers' suck now. Otherwise the game is complex in strategy yet simple enough for the average user to pick up and progress quickly. At first that is, once you get to a certain level you'll be grinding for years unless you pay hundreds of dollars.",4,2018-12-21 13:32:47
"The game has been moving from skill based to pay to play. You're pretty limited in your progression until you start to spend money. For example, the 5 dollar monthly subscription which gives you double the awards and more than double the value of what you would usually earn progressing freely. It is a great game overall and I'm a few years in veteran",4,2022-03-30 18:55:42
"Fun game.Addictive.Takes long time to level up. Edit: After 4 years I have to say the game is now trash. After you get to the high ranks it can take months to upgrade a card. Everyone you play literally just waits until you play so they can set up a perfect combo that you cant counter. Then you wait 30 seconds and they do it again. Also the progression stops. Once you get to 5000 trophies everyone has max level cards and if you go on a win streak, you will go on a lose streak. Negative trophies",2,2021-04-13 07:48:35
"I've played all the clash games for a couple of years, this one is the most unstable and frustrating to play. Constant freezes and crashes during play. Once they banned me for an hour because they thought I was leaving the game intentionally. Ive rebooted phone and WiFi router, hasn't helped. Finally uninstalled and reinstalled game, waiting to see what happens. Decided to leave review for others. I like the game but if this reinstall doesn't work it's gone. I don't have these issues with boom Beach or clash of clans.",1,2018-12-15 20:45:13
"The whole point of this game is to get people to spend money. It's only enjoyable if you have maxed out meta cards, and even then, the matching algorithm makes you lose enough to never truly climb until you've pumped some more money in. My advice: like all addictions, you'll wish you wouldn't have started. It's fun at first but when you get good at it, it'll get the better of you.",1,2021-10-02 06:50:43
"Pay for play, just stay away! Used to be fun but they constantly tweak it and have ruined the experience. Older cards are weakened (mega knight) and newer cards are too powerful (electro giant). Plays extremely slow at times where your opponent will be able to play cards more quickly putting you at a significant disadvantage. If you don't spend $ on it you'll be ok, if you do it will be a complete waste as whatever you invest in will be tweaked until it's useless causing you to spend more.",1,2023-01-22 09:37:36
"It is a very fun game from the start... Then you get to higher arenas and it just becomes this pay to win system where skill doesn't even matter and it's just about having high levels and all of the new cards on release, it's a shame really, and now they added pass Royale to even further the pay to win aspect of the game. Once you get 5k trophies just stop playing unless you want to spend money.",2,2019-09-11 03:14:56
"This game is so much fun, one of the most addictive games I've played on a phone, or even in general. Unfortunately, as many reviews have stated it takes WAY too long to open up the chests, however I don't agree with people when they say that ruins the game, you can always still earn trophies/achievements even when your chest slots are full. And when it is I play just to earn them and improve my skill level and find the right team combinations. I also expirence connection problems I would say about 30%",4,2018-12-16 12:56:13
"Rigged matchmaking and pay-to-win biased. At first, the game looks balanced and fine, but the more you progress on the ladder, the more difficult it gets. Not because of players and cards, but because matchmaking is unfair - either the game puts you against a player that is 2 level higher than you or against someone who has season pass and clearly has an advantage. I really like this game, I've played for more than 3 years, but now I've decided to stop playing definitively. The game algorithm is so deceptive that when you're on a loosing streak it doesn't matter how many decks you switch, how many legendary and combos you use, and how much time you spent without playing it, you'll always face someone with a deck that's perfect for neutralizing yours. There comes a point you realise it's designed to make you lose more than win. To make you feel frustrated in order to trigger you to buy season pass and all the pay-to-win nonsense. I've never spent a penny on this, and I wish more people did the same and boycott. It gets worse year after year. 3/5",3,2020-11-05 06:00:54
"It was great at first. I really enjoyed the game and quickly rose up the ladder. It was exciting and fun, for a time. Once I reached max level I started to really struggle to level up my cards and it has become worse with more cards and the same little rewards. I didnt see it much when I was lower level and lower on the ladder, but they really emphasize the spend money to stay competitive feature. I cant fault them, it is a business at the end of the day, but it killed my fun.",2,2021-10-28 01:20:13
"It is very painful that I open the application and let me play ""normal"" 4 or 5 games, after those games it starts to go slow and bug at the start of the game the screen does not work and the troops on the contrary they begin to move in fast motion and in one demolish my towers without allowing me to attack. and not only that, there are times when the screen freezes for minutes and when defrosting, I'm back on the menu of the app, losing 20-30 trophies or bug and make my phone reboot alone.",1,2019-08-16 09:31:02

It's been great to take a break from work, have a few battles, help the clan etc... except it's progressively become pay to win, and the evolution cards have taken away almost all the fun.

But anyways, very good game, very fun and addicting. The challenges and tournaments need a fix on matchmaking. I end up facing higher levels than me. This gives them an advantage in card placing, card leveling, and all that. I think it's unfair whenever I lose to level 12 or 13 .",4,2019-03-18 16:26:32

"Game was good and now it's frustrating. It matches you with higher levels than you. I'm a level 11 and it's always matching me up with level 13. Towers have more hp, troops are all maxed out. Nothing I can do to beat them. Been on a losing streak cause of it. This takes the fun out of this game and it's becoming dumb! I spend money in the game and for what? To keep losing. Supercell needs to fix the match making. Even if it goes by trophy level, they should make it go by tower level not trophies",1,2020-01-11 18:27:00

As if those weren't bad enough, the supposedly existing confirmation step didn't come when I accidentally entered a challenge with a 100 gems...

"The game's great but the battles are almost always against someone who's at least 3 levels ahead of me... I see that players are matched based on their trophies, but when you're resetting the trophies of all players to 4000 at season ends, it's a tough fight for people who just entered 4k trophies and easy win for those who have been playing it for so long. Both the players tend to lose interest. Try matching up players based on levels instead of trophies may be...!?",2,2020-05-24 11:34:22
"I wanted to like this game. Believe me, I really did. But it's a bit hard to like it when the algorithm sets you up for failure. I always get matched with people that always seem to have exact counters to all the cards I have. I would've passed it off as chance encounters, but this has consistently happened to me in the last 20 matches I've played, most of which I've lost. It's very demotivating to lose so many times in a row, which is why I'm uninstalling. Supercell needs to fix this.",1,2020-05-25 08:23:07
"Terrible experience since past 2 days. My internet is top speed , every video, every app works flawlessly. But this game just loses connection every now and then and then just basically hangs. It takes pressing hardware buttons on the phone to make the app go to the background somehow so it can be terminated. Even hangs on simply starting up some times. I'm losing so many trophies just because the game thought I was offline.",1,2020-07-17 12:43:08
"It's a fun game, but it constantly crashes after a few matches. All the solutions seem to point towards user side error but I don't want to force my phone to give a game more ram. Honestly, instead of making the player fix the issue, why can't y'all just update the game to fix it? Furthermore, when I do re-enter the game mid match, it freezes on the google play account popup and makes it impossible to counter the enemy.",1,2023-06-12 23:12:11
"I've been playing this game for years, and I leave this game for years. I want to play this game because of it's strategy, I don't want to play this game because of it's development system.

The time what necessary is too much. I think the game needs to get easier.",3,2021-07-08 21:54:42
"3 years on from my original review, Supercell has been proactive with maintaining interest in the game.

Continued balance changes are good for longevity, but it would be good to see a revisit on the matchmaking algorithms.",3,2019-10-17 17:19:28
"Good game I guess but, now that level 14 is here. It's hard to level up and get to a next level when you'll randomly get matched with a guy 4 levels above you or more. And I don't know what to do about this but, sometimes I'll start a match and then the person your fighting has there cards boosted with speed. I don't know if anyone else has had this problem, but please fix it. As of now in my opinion the game is unbalanced. Please fix this as fast you can and I'll change my rating.",2,2021-11-25 11:11:23

I've lost over 300 trophies today alone.",3,2019-07-28 03:18:51
"Addicting and infuriating, the matchmaking has been heavily critized and I respect that, but my issue is that the game so far has experienced not one, not two but numerous crashes during or at the end of a match and its either the game itself or the internet connection but its never been this often that this happens. I've played the game since launch and it still holds up as a fun game but jeez too many crashes",4,2020-04-22 11:50:07

I doubt these problems will be fixed though because they probably aren't common",2,2019-11-22 00:37:35
It's difficult but not impossible if you don't pay for their BS. No kind of match making and now with their card evolutions monsters having added effects? blatant pay to win for streamers and whales. It was an unnecessary add on.,1,2025-10-05 13:01:36
"The game is a lot different than it used to be. They just keep adding more and more new garbage so they can justify raising the prices on things and making more things cost money. Odds are if you don't spend money to buy whatever new evolution or champion there is, you'll get beaten by a person who has. It feels like the developers are entirely disconnected from what players want. Evolution was a totally unnecessary concept to begin with. Fun as a beginner but playing high level is total hell.",2,2023-08-26 23:09:29
"DON'T install it. The app crashes, there's lag, connection breakdowns, player matches way below and above our gamer's skills.

Because I've played for 3 years and I'll wait for a change.",1,2019-12-28 23:44:24
"I used to play it a lot more a couple of years ago, the problem imo is that at a certain point after clearing the ""normal"" arenas, it gets really hard to stay competitive. The best decks in meta change a lot and it is almost impossible to get all cards maxed out without paying money which is why you have to stick with one or two decks. This leads to you not being able to compete once these decks aren't as good anymore.",3,2021-08-17 02:34:42
"This used to be one of my favorite mobile games. It was incredibly fun but still challenging in a fairly balanced way. I feel though the game is still mostly well designed, Supercell's failure (or just plain indifference) in solving key issues with the game such as matchmaking and ridiculously high ingame and real money prices for lackluster rewards has lowered its fun factor and raised the frustration level to make the game less enjoyable to play.",3,2019-08-05 05:57:44
This is one of the best multiplayer games. And it needs brain too. Tactical. Nice graphics and features. News Royale is also up to date and interesting. And the best part is it loads quickly. No lags. Moderate crashes. It also consumes very less internet traffic. Edit: It is taking too long to load the game. And it's not a network problem as other online games work just fine. I have a decent 4G internet. Please fix this ASAP. Quality > Quantity. You should ramp up Quality Checking a bit.😇,1,2020-05-13 16:35:58

I provided screen shots of the issue to a rep when it initially happened, have followed up a couple times but no one has been able to give me anything for the chests /weekly bonus that was lost. Just keep responding that oh we are working on it.",1,2023-04-16 08:03:06
"This used to be, hands down my favorite game to play, i would spend hours a day climbing trophies or practicing new decks. i have played since beta and continued to play for 3 full years. I have gradually stopped playing as much since the game takes forever to progress when you only have epics and legendary cards to upgrade, and they don't update the game as much as  they used to. 2 years ago every update had at 4 cards released, now we get a new card every few months. The game just doesn't feel the same. Still love the dev team and the game as a whole, it's just doesnt at all feel like it used to.",3,2019-02-03 01:54:51
"I play this game for a long period off time.. On the top levels you need to buy to be able to survive the levels. The game is not really fare.. 2 levels difference when u battle (level 8 with level 10).. Towers different powers, characters different levels. I quit playing it start to be very annoying game now. To become a top player you need to add seriously cash into. Notting new added every day and week same ans same..",2,2019-12-10 03:11:39
"I love this game. This I a suggestion: the game can get a little boring sometimes, so something you could add to make it more fun is adding a button for random deck or pick a category(air, buildings, melee, etc) and not know which cards you bring into the next battle. This would be especially fun for friendly battles, where trophies don't matter!",3,2021-10-28 01:06:38
"When I first started playing this game I loved it. It's so fun. But then their matching system became very corrupt. how long it's been that way, I'm not entirely positive. after noticing a losing streak trend that had weird things happening I started reading gaming forums for answers. They have a ""losing pool"" (fixed losing) that you get stuck in and can't get out for 15 or 20 games. It's been said they do it to even out the winners but I it's dishonest to the players. It's killing this game.",2,2022-06-28 10:31:07
"I've played this game since launch. I got up to player lvl 10. This game is great early, a lot of fun, but once you get into the upper leagues be prepared to waste lots and lots of time. I've played this game for an hour straight and gotten 75 to 80% draws. You get constantly bombarded with annoying emotes. This game has a lot of great potential to be great but there's just too many infuriating aspects making it unplayable after you get so far.",2,2019-04-11 22:19:56
"If you happen to be one of the lucky few who haven't layed this game, don't bother. The game has evolved over time from a simple and fun spin-off game to an absolute pay to play nightmare. When you first start the game, the in-game shop is small, no battle pass available, etc. However, as you progress, the game seems match you up with decks that 'conveniently' counter your deck, while the shop gets bigger and bigger. I've seen as many as 20+ purchase options at once, totaling in the hundreds.",1,2023-12-07 10:03:17
"These new updates makes the game much more unbearable. I don't need to play triple draft for a whole season - I sometimes skip those fights altogether because it takes a lot of time and it's more based on luck of the draw than real skill and strategy. Those already maxed out at trophy road would feel this much more since there's no way to go but down from there. With all these changes, I really question why I play anymore",1,2023-04-05 19:46:54
"The game was fine until the discovery of 2v2 battles in challenge modes. I don't get to select the partner of my choice, and then I get one who either leaves the game or isn't as skilled as I am. This problem should be fixed as soon as possible as it makes no sense at all. I waste like 100 gems for the challenge by playing it again and what I get in return is nothing.",1,2018-11-22 14:41:12
Absolutely addicted (idk if that's a good or a bad thing) but it's pay to win for sure. I painstakingly save up the minimal resources I get to upgrade without paying. I paid for the month pass ONE TIME and made more progress in one month than I had in over a year otherwise. Also the addition of a firecracker evolution has almost broken the game. Probably 95% of the decks I play against use that card. And here I thought the goal of the game was to make a balanced experience. Joke's on me.,1,2023-09-05 11:37:34
"Playing since beginning. Fun and addictive gameplay stopped me from not playing. Love it. Edit-1: Experiencing improper scaling issue after the recent update. Also, 2v2 matchmaking taking forever making it unable to find a match. Edit-2: After 7 years of playing, I no longer think this game deserves my attention because of their anti F2P campaign they've started recently. Bad updates one after another makes this game not fun anymore. I guess we can call it the ""Tencent effect"".",1,2023-04-08 18:06:55
"I enjoy the game but find it annoying that I'm in the legendary aurena where I face people who are stacked with legendarys and I can't get a single one. It's not balanced... edit.... with the new updates. There are moments with such huge lags in the game, it can cause a huge turn of events that can cause you to lose. edit: After all the updates, I feel that supercell has done a good job to keep the game balanced and continues progression.",4,2019-01-29 06:19:39
"Used to be a fun game now it's just frustrating. If you don't spend money, good luck. I spend a little but I'm not going to spend the amount required to level up quick, continue tournaments, or buy the Passes every month. Lots of new additions where if you don't buy upgrades you will get slautered. My biggest complaint is the App crashing in the middle of a game, sometimes multiple times. Half of my losses are do to the game crashing. Very frustrating.",1,2023-10-11 23:17:00
"Ever since the last update it takes forever to find opponents, I usually hit cancel because the system takes forever to search. Then I'm usually matched up against opponents that are a few levels higher than me. Also, when I go to drop troops it sometimes takes 3 or more seconds for them to actually drop. If I could give this game negative stars, I would!",1,2019-11-27 20:04:40
"This game is fun to play however it seems at times that the game gets laggy and you can't play troops at the beginning resulting in losing a tower right off the bat. Countless times the game has stopped working in the middle of a match causing me to log back in only to find the game over. Also multiple times I have gone on ""losing streaks"" which seem a little too convenient,  sometimes 13 consecutive.  It is very frustrating when you play these games for fun and invest money that it can make you sooo mad.",4,2019-11-27 22:13:59
"Been playing for 6+ years and really enjoyed the game. Its now unplayable. Game crashes multiple times per match. Sometimes I can't even open the app without it crashing 10 times in a row. You would think with all the obnoxious cash grab concepts creeping into the game, that they would have the money to fix these bugs. Huge disappointment from a game I really loved",1,2023-12-05 08:22:53
"This is an awesome game but there is a massive bug that I'm not happy with.... I have come along way in the game, and I unlocked the Arena 2, then when I clicked battle, it wouldn't work, I was searching for opponents for 10 minutes and nothing would come up, then I pressed cancel and it did nothing! Fix this! Email me when u get this comment, thanks! <3",4,2019-01-20 01:14:44
"The concept of playing units/buildings in real time is very interesting. However, the development team seemed to have gotten comfortable with the game. Out of the three years I played there has only been a handful of sporatic content update and most of them do as much harm as they do good. The balance system is neglected , the rewards are meh, the progression is slow, the UI degrades over time, and the dev communication gets worse and worse. I'm out of words but essentially get out while you can",1,2023-03-28 10:03:06
"Good game. the people who complain about the algorithms, it goes off of trophies, not your own personal level. So if you gain enough trophies to play with a king tower higher than yours, good for you. Yes, people advance faster when they spend money, but you don't need to spend money to advance. I have played this game for years on and off, and am almost at a level 13 king tower and have plenty of level 13 cards without spending a dime Anyone who says that they need to spend money is impatient",4,2021-03-03 07:51:10
"This can be a really fun game. Until you constantly lose and get matched up with people 2 levels above you. Nothing like losing 8 games in a row at a high level, then being ahead and losing connection. 3. Matches. In. A. Row. The game can be really fun when it works right, but the matchup system is really unfair, and the connection errors half way through a game are infuriating. Still gets 3 stars from me, so you know I like it when it is fair.",3,2018-11-21 01:46:52
"I've been playing this game for a few years now and have been through many of the changes and updates. Some I thought were great, while others missed the mark. Clash Royale offers a pay-for-progress, but that doesn't necessarily mean victory. Players that choose to play for free are still capable of achieving the same end goals as players that pay, albeit at a much slower pace. In individual matches, both the free and pay-for-play players are effectively on a balanced playing field creating a thrilling and competitive environment. I was a free player and over the course of the previous few years, have been slowly progressing up the ladder and upgrading my cards to remain competitive at the higher levels. Understandably, as you get closer to the top, progress slows down considerably, but doesn't stop completely. For a free player like myself, it's annoying but manageable. Enter update December 2018. Supercell unveiled a number of changes that seem to target their paying customers (I don't fault them, just an observation). However, a side effect is my already slow progress has slowed even further. Combined with the almost monotonous gameplay (facing streaks with multiple different opponents that are all rocking the same exact deck) that I've experienced for the last 9-12 months, it is a little too much for me. It's been fun, but I've reached my natural end game and it's time for me to walk away.",3,2018-12-07 11:21:50
"this was my favourite game but i don't like it anymore. it's laggy, there's way too much bugs. it disconnects in the middle of a battle. for being one of the biggest games, i was expecting there to be less bugs. it's pretty much pay to win, i've also heard if you try to drop trophies, you get stuck with other trophy droppers and it's annoying.",2,2018-12-06 03:04:55
"Really well made game. The card that are not newly added are well balanced, the game modes are fun, and if you can find good combinations of cards, then you're unstoppable (well, for a while :) ) and you have a way to play it completely free. The main problems are usually the newly added cards being overpowered and at the season end, the game becomes rather unstable. Note that though this game needs a huge cache that can easily go past 1 gb size, so you need to watch your storage space.",4,2021-06-07 19:08:09
"In terms of gameplay and graphics, it's amazing. Very addicting and what not. However, gave it at 3 because once you hit level 8 and up, it is IMPOSSIBLE to compete fairly without being forced to spend money to even get a fair game in. You will never unlock all the cards or be able to compete at a high level without spending money. I refuse to drop a dime on this game for principle.",3,2018-10-02 01:42:35
"This should be a good game. But, it IS pay to win. Beyond the first levels, there is NO WAY to advance without paying. And then only a little. The more you pay, the higher you go. Otherwise, you run in place. Advance and you face two or three levels above, like a primary school team vs college or pro. No way to win Pay and you get higher level. Lose a few, you face lower - too easy. Also, it's a bit rock-paper-scissors. Other guy's cards are unstoppable or a walk over, but can't change mid game",1,2021-04-12 03:23:44
I enjoy playing the game but have gotten a virus or something that keeps knocking me off line every time I enter a battle. I like the weekend battles if I could only stay on long enough to actually battle & lags in response time. Happened for several months now. I have tried virus scans on my phone. Nothing found. Never had this issue before; just after the last major game update. I don't want to have to uninstall but only other thing I can think of trying. Sincerely frustrated.,1,2019-01-26 08:44:11
I have played this game for years hoping that it would improve. It has not. The match making algorithm has you climbing trophies to get close to 'rewards' then changes to make u drop all of the trophies and more. This happens on an hourly basis going up and down on the same but never making any progress. The matching making also seems to match u up with either player/bots that have no idea what they are doing or perfect counters either way waste of time playing this.,1,2021-07-22 17:04:16
"I left the game a year ago after playing for 3 years because it became unbalanced and really hard to have fun. I returned a few weeks ago because I hoped it had changed. It hasn't. At its core this is a great game. Fun, slick and easy to play free or paid. It has a great community too. The problem is some card combos just ruin the experience. I made it to challenger level and king level 13 and it doesn't change. Skill isn't rewarded as much as just playing the overpowered cards and winning.",3,2022-04-14 14:29:13
The recent update killed free to play progression and took away a large part of the game's charm by removing chests. Edit: ok THIS recent upgrade left the f2p progression dead in a ditch and removed any semblance of the game that once was. shame.,1,2025-11-24 17:54:34
"The matchmaking algorithm is unfair, dishonest and manipulated. I've been playing about 3 years and I'd say there's some sort of ""winning score"" for each player based on his skills and other variables and you'll be matched with opponents with higher ""winning score"" most of the times if you don't pay, especially in a challenge mode. Lots of times I've won for about 6 or 7 matches and lose for 3 times in a row when I spend gems to replay. Most probably my opponents have just started participating.",1,2019-06-10 11:36:04
"Fun, well designed game. The issue I have with the game is the need to pay for stuff to unlock any of the decent characters. I understand the need to make money, but I haven't unlocked any legendary characters and I refuse to pay for it. It unlevels the playing field when I'm playing against someone and they paid to unlock and upgrade all their characters",1,2022-03-24 11:35:58
The game has become laggy. I lost so many matches because of weird laggy animations especially in case of golden knight. Its movement is very unpredictable. Its just straight up annoying. Also the game has become slow after the updates. even if you have a good internet it still shows that wifi icon in the middle. Haven't had these kind of issues in while. I'm taking a break from this game. Hopefully these issues will get fixed till then,1,2023-01-07 01:19:41
"It's a unique game with a great number of characters to choose from, gameplay is fun, special modes are cool and such. But one huge problem with the game is that, when I get into a game, the other player is 2 or 3 levels higher than me. But not only that they have high leveled cards (some gold) and they just spit out 4 and 5 elixir cards out of no where. This game is unfair and really unfortunate.",3,2020-06-14 18:29:58
"Clash Royale is one of the best games on mobile; polished, competitive, accessible. The most recent update made some great progress forward. Unfortunately, instead of only requiring one person per trade to have a trade token... It now takes both players. Trade tokens were rare to start with. Now, it's even rarer to participate in trades. I think this is more frustrating because it seems like a step backward, promoting more money spent for something that used to be really neat and mostly free.",4,2018-12-06 04:54:38
"If you have an IQ above 80, this game will make you want to punch a hole in the wall. The matchmaking algorithm is so insanely horrible. You basically win a bunch of games in a row and start to play other people who are 2 levels higher than you with max lvl cards. It's essentially pointless to play them because they 3 tower you without even trying. When you hit this ceiling you have two options; you can play out 10 losing games in a row and get pissed, or you can press ""battle"" and close the app",1,2021-04-03 15:41:06
"the game concept is fun, the new changes are great, the gameplay is worse than ever; there has been an excuse given, that it must be network related. while a cell tower can trunk out/be full, I've played at off hours and experienced this same issue. it's not a memory issue, I've over 10 GB of storage unused; I've tried clearing caches, the data, uninstall/re-in, but it's not making any difference, even on full LTE bars. This points to the servers or game to me, but i can't give 4 or 5 stars yet.",3,2019-06-27 03:01:57
"Everything is very expensive here. New cards take 40,000 coins to unlock, but you only get 44 coins per win. The chests don't give you much, either. Also, it takes a long time for chests to unlock. In battles, it is often that your opponent(s) are one or even more levels above you, which can be very annoying. Sometimes, your opponent is unloading cards while you are still going through preparations. Otherwise, a very good game to kill time.",3,2020-11-18 19:10:33
"Overall, it's a great real time strategy game with variety of card combos to choose in defeating your opponents. But the major downside is the 'cancel' option which doesn't quite work, especially keeping you locked in a searching for players screen till the app resets. The game's mostly about upgrading for the most part since being at tower level 1 restricts play to just the features of Battle & Party. Joining a clan is moot because you can't donate as a level 1 player. Great time-killer though.",2,2020-11-19 06:51:34
"i'm really not sure what they're going for at this point. It's certainly no longer fun. I want to like it, I've installed + uninstalled about a dozen times the past couple years, but this'll be my last. I just can't. Balance is really, really bad. Nonsensical frills make gameplay and app navigation literally exhausting. Wars aren't fun. Microtransactions everywhere. If you're looking at picking this up, I highly recommend you save yourself some time, energy & look elsewhere (player since launch)",1,2023-10-24 12:02:02
"I have mixed feelings. The game seems a whole lot more beginner friendly as it was in 2020. Cards are easier to level up, and trophies inflation was a thing of the past. I still have an issue with how time-consuming to max a card though, and in 6.3k, non-maxed cards are a huge disvantage. The main issue here is that the slow rate of chest flow leads to an even slower rate of card flow, and thus levelling up becomes harder.",3,2022-03-31 01:40:38
"Playing this game for a while. It started off fine, however this is an extremely p2w setup. Although I'm making decent progress, there is a pay wall to progress. Matchmaking is terrible, in that you are often playing against higher levels. I don't know why it can't be based on trophy level even in challenges? I'm playing against opponents with 2000+ trophy difference regularly. I also feel that the game is designed to force you to want to pay to buy cards. The core game is fine.",1,2024-01-15 02:23:49
"I stand by my original review, the chest unlocking system is still garbage, but with the introduction of pass royale (the free one) and trophy rewards, chests (or at least unlockable ones) are no longer your main way of getting new unit types. This ensures that you'll get all of the units you need eventually, making the game more fun to play as a result due to the ability to actually engage in the amazing deck personalization and exhilarating, fast-paced mind games that this game promotes.",4,2020-11-19 23:00:47
"After playing for longer, I had to change my review. This game becomes a stressful mess when it comes to ladder and sometimes wars, the game has become frustrating and almost a chore. I still like it a bit though, I like clans and challenges, but that might be it. Don't play this game if you rage even a little bit, because Clash Royale will bring out the worst of you at times.",3,2019-02-27 01:22:19
My enjoyment of the game is diminishing with the recent introduction of the River race challenge. I don't understand why when I win a battle against an opponent my clan ship goes backwards. The multiple weeks of races gets dull. The game is still somewhat enjoyable but not as much. The game seems to have kicked me out and I can't login to it. It's not sending me the confirmation code for my email. Tried a few times now... really strange. Guess I'm done playing it.,3,2020-12-28 04:30:46
"Weather when it's starting the game or ending a match, it takes years, and if there's a little bit of lag, it gives you a disadvantage, not to mention if the game so happens to even crash, nine times out of ten you will lose the battle. This is terrible when you are doing a challenge or event and the game blacks out so you lose the match. It doesnt help that the battle pass is terrible, with nearly every company doing the same thing where you must pay with real money and not in game currency",3,2019-07-02 03:30:29
they added a lot of new stuff too the game since I left however the late game is now PAY TOO WIN all the evolution cards are now in a pay wall and if you can't level up too 15 well too bad you are going too have a hard time playing ANYTHING TO DO WITH WAR GAME MODES. I almost say I give up every game because I know they have an advantage. terrible for a returning player because you get nothing against this and is incredibly one sided,3,2025-11-09 01:09:54
"Used to be great, but the experience keeps getting worse. Random freezes, losses of connection, etc, that end up resulting in lost battles in absurd ways (for example, I play a card, but it won't put it in the game because it loses connection to the server, then it puts my card at the wrong time, etc). Will Uninstall.",1,2021-04-14 19:32:57
Changing my rating from 5-star to 1-star. I love the game but the app has shown so many technical glitches in the recent past. I have reported it multiple times but there has been no response from Supercell. The game keeps on crashing on my phone whenever I open it. I have missed several war day battles because of this glitch. Have been playing the game for last 3 years and I think now I will have to move on just because of this incompetence of Supercell.,1,2020-04-06 14:36:06
"I have been playing this game for 4 years and I absolutely love it. Its unique, not too hard to get used too and loads of fun. But that's until you reach the legendary arena... because there your skill almost does not matter anymore and the game becomes almost pay-to-win until you reach the max level (13) but if you are planning to reach the maze level without putting any money in the game it might take you 2 to 3 years of regular playing.",2,2021-02-18 16:39:37
"The game feels and plays very well. Gameplay does become repetitive at higher arenas and that makes it hard to play for extended periods. It also feels extremely pay-to-win as you can level up cards much faster with some $$. Overall I'd say the game is excellent for a mobile game, but the pay-to-win aspect and the repetitive gameplay at higher arenas keeps it from being a 5/5 in my book.",4,2021-10-27 23:46:57
"Fun game but requires a huge time investment and/or money investment to fully enjoy the experience. Upgrading cards is a long, long road. I've been playing for 3 years now and have payed upwards of $1000 and still don't have everything maxed or anywhere close to it. However, it's a novel and unique experience. The gameplay is timeless and this formula can go on forever. If you have the patience for molasses slow progression then you will enjoy this game thoroughly.",4,2019-10-17 18:11:37
"An issue i (and as i have been told many other have) reported roughly four big updates ago that they promised they were working on still isn't fixed. In normal draft battles sometimes the last choice you make is switched once the match starts leaving you with the card you specifically didn't choose. The replay shows the switched choices, making you question whether the error was on your side. It is not. This can be observed and reproduced fairly often, and they still didn't do anything about it.",3,2019-10-17 22:53:42
"Fun and easy game; once you reach the highest of levels, it's matchmaking system sucks. My standard deck consists of a few maxes and 12s but when I want to try something new, cards near or below tournament level I'll play 2v2. According to the tips, it matches based on a mix of skill and card level, but it isn't fair in the least for me to be paired with a lvl 10 fighter and facing an enemy team with max level cards. I understand there is a training ground but that doesn't feel the same.",3,2020-10-28 03:10:50
Great game in the beginning. Lots of room for creativity. As you progress in the game it becomes very repetitive and typically the fastest way to succeed is to pay a lot of money and then copy the most successful decks from other players. By playing the less efficient decks that might be more original you're usually at a disadvantage. Great game if you you're OK with paying a lot and copying what others do. Not much room for creativity and success.,3,2022-06-27 18:06:57
"Alright, I've been playing this game for years and have to change from 1 star to 4 stars. Not going into all the details, but the pay to win was always a huge problem to me. Once I finally got a few cards maxed for a few good decks, I find it more fair and do very well against other maxed players. It took way too long to level up and for a while I would only log in to collect free chests, and request cards. Regardless of everything I love the game a lot. Clash Royale made a genre of it's own.",4,2020-11-18 16:23:52
"A con!!!!!!!!! This game may seem great at the start but as you go up the levels you will start to see the patterns appearing, it is definitely fixed by the game designers so you don't reach the top. If you see through the facade there is no point playing and definitely not pay for gems!!! P.s they never answer any emails so your on your own!!!!",1,2023-01-13 01:44:16
"Used to be fun, played for years. Now complete cashgrab. Essentially, you can still play fair ranked solo battles and the various game modes that keep changing, but forget joining a clan. Clan battles no longer have modes where the card levels are capped, so unless you have played for years or PAID to progress faster, you will always be at a disadvantage. Good while it lasted, but now ruined.",2,2020-09-21 21:51:16
"Another great game, spoilt by greedy developers. This used to be a fun, casual game you could play when you get a spare minute. Now, it's completely pay to win with so many 'premium' options. Long time (8 years+) player, and this is the worst it's been. Matchmaking is also very bios once you get to a certain level, making it impossible to get further without using YouTube decks. Terrible game and nothing like it used to be.",1,2023-04-09 11:58:02
"The gameplay is very good, until you get to some of the higher arenas, where the game becomes pay-to-win. Not really a way to fix this. I also dont like the overabundance of new emotes, since the only real way to get them is to spend hard earned gems. My opinion of the game has gone downhill, since I advanced through arenas very quickly, and hit a standstill trying to make the first league.",3,2019-07-11 21:33:46
They screwed with the algorithm again. Now just because of lvl I'm always matched with far more skilled players. I'm a casual gamer having to fight tooth and nail just to perform routine tasks is not fun. I was already thinking about deleting this app for good. This might be the final nail after 3 plus years and unknown (but high) monetary investment. Including $5 per season since the first 1. Update I've deleted the app might try again in six months.,1,2021-07-17 00:03:47
"Edit: 1 star can't even use the app UPDATE : I get fake notifications telling me chests have been unlocked, also the free chests icon sometimes shows more notification dots than there should be. There's no easy way to report bugs. The connection can be really poor, even on stable WiFi and 4G, recently I have noticed more and more connection dropouts. The re-connect system is poor, there needs to be a feature to help this along and give a 20-30 second window to the player that lost connection...",1,2022-03-31 00:16:26
"The game is frequently updated and balanced. There are many events for both single player and guilds. One thing to note however, is that it can prove challenging to reach high ranks without purchasing in game currency or grinding really hard. I chose the latter and still only made it onto the leaderboards once. Great game and if you enjoy fast paced strategy then I highly recommend!",4,2020-03-22 08:04:06
"6/27/2022. War is horrible. They need to make an AFK or story mode, the mode is a waste of time given there is no levelling and you have limited cards to use. If it wasnt for the gold nobody would play it. Its showing its age but nothing better is coming along. But again, war needs to be cancelled and new modes invented. War, what is it good for, absolutely nothing!! (Except a bit of extra gold and a way to waste 3 minutes of your life not having fun, but clanmates sook when you dont play it)",3,2022-06-27 21:02:22
"I've had many bad experiences with, especially mobile, games that are bombarded with ads or purchases, but this one takes the crown, it doesn’t have ads, but it's in-game purchases are ridiculously expensive, since you need >200€ to upgrade a card to level 12 (from 11, assuming you already collected all the cards needed for the upgrade). And when you're close to getting to a new Arena, the game intentionally pairs you with bots or pay-to-win players that have all cards at least 1-2 level higher",1,2023-03-22 14:04:32
It's a good game. The pairing system is horrible. How does a level 7 get paired with a level 10? They have all these super rare cards and the other player only has one and a lot of common cards. Seems like the only way to win in this game is by spending money. Update: uninstalled due to players having to pay to win. This game used to be fun. On to a new game,1,2020-01-11 22:30:27
"I've been playing for months I love it. Has some glitches that need to be fixed. It tells me wifi signal isn't good and will log me out alot during battles when my wifi is fine. It also won't let me open the app as of 10/26/21 since the lvl 14 update it keeps telling me I need to update and there isn't one. So I've paid to play, and I can't play.",2,2021-10-28 00:55:52

Progression feels impossible, also most carts aren't even fair they to way to much damage.

"Solid game concept and design, my only problem is with the lack of ways to play the game, pretty much there will always be a really buffed card and will be played often, or one so weak it never sees play. After a while it got boring when certain cards became meta. There should be different maps or concepts to keep the game going. I got this game for android the hour it came out and have the game many times, it just doesn't become fun after a while.",4,2018-12-30 00:40:45
"Really addicting gameplay but it a) has engagement based matchmaking so the game picks and chooses which deck you go against to make you either win or lose and b) is REALLY pay to win. So pay to win that for a while after reinstalling the game, google play would crash due to the sheer amount of microtransations there were. I feel that the game would be way, way better if it just wasn't so darn greedy.",2,2025-11-15 06:10:44

"You have the nerve to put bans on players even after they've spent money on the game? nah. thats too much. there's a reason many of us fell off this game years ago. pay to win. you actually have the nerve to charge 80 plus for something that will only upgrade 2 cards at most, and not give you an entire game like a normal market. the banning for players leaving is the icing on the cake. the company has gotten too greedy. dont waste your time.",1,2025-10-28 23:52:42

"worst game in the gaming history. shame on such a big gaming company like supercell cant even manage games properly. The game loses network in the middle of a crucial match , i was playing my finals in my college tournament where this happened due to which I eventually lost the finals.

"The overall mechanics of the game are fun, though sadly it has become nothing more than a cash grab in recent years. Shop offers becoming more and more expensive and offering poor value, new overpowered cards being released which can only realistically be obtained by spending money and progression being next to impossible without buying the aforementioned offers. The game being pay to win has become even more noticeable nowadays.",1,2024-02-03 04:11:45
Obviously sometimes there are matchmaking issues between higher level players against lower levelled players in the same arena.

This also happens more and more time when matchmaking and the screen suddenly stops. My mobile is in the Snapdragon 8Gen2 so I dont really find any reason the game is failing.",1,2026-01-29 13:27:11

"After playing for 6 years the game has gotten to a bad state. it's filed with p2w, and it makes it easily the most unfun and unbalanced game ever. always releasing overpowered cards which guess what, you can buy to get immediately. And the addition of more and more levels, bad progression system. It's not the same casual game you can pick up and enjoy",1,2025-12-26 18:25:52
"adding level sixteen. Extremely predatory towards children with access to credit cards. Terrible leveling experience. Balence changes based off of use rate instead of actual combat statistics. Requires a big amount of time and money to be somewhat competive. In order to be even a little competive, you must constantly spend money. Wether it be in the item shop, buying the diamond pass, or a new broken card comes out that you must buy and use to be competitive. This game was dead, shoud die again",1,2025-11-17 23:07:46
"I believe that you should bring more things to free to play players because you always find over leveled opponents except if you grind and get your whole deck level 15.

Is p2w, so for me I don't pay, it makes it hard to advance arenas. I like the setup and how it works. I like doing friendly battles, because your towers have the same health. Makes me rage because I face p2w every other match or something. Love the game, play or a lot, add a new card soon. That would low-key be peak.",4,2025-10-08 17:39:11

They added so many new cards and evolutions that it's impossible for f2p players like me to keep up. Additionally, I feel like the game's matchmaking mechanics are designed to make you lose.

Clash would be better if match making was improved more and there was maxed levels for each arena so someone cant have a level 15 evo pekka in arena one and so the game would be a lot more fair cards wise.

You don't make progress without spending money, and now with the addition of the diamond pass, giving low level players incredibly powerful and unfair cards makes it almost impossible to progress.

worst game ive ever played in my life extremely pay to win cards are imbalanced cant even i cant even win a game at 7500 trophy on a 12 losing streak rn,1,2026-02-03 13:45:39
"The more updates they put on here the more the bugs and glitches come, i just had to delete and reinstall because it wouldn't even get past the 50%, after that it said updating and lost connection, although my connection was perfectly fine. This problem needs to be fixed, also there is slow game play when setting losts of troops down, it slows or feezes. I really enjoy the game but these bugs need to be fixed.",4,2020-01-03 12:36:46
"I have been a fan of CR and have been playing it for almost 10 years. But after these recent updates, the game has become IMPOSSIBLE to play without spending unreasonable amounts of money. It makes me sad to say that I am quitting the game.",1,2025-09-03 09:41:27
I was around 14000 traphy. after today's update. they took me down to 11700. why the hell they do this... check this bug... it is un ethical. I gave my time to this game. that's not the way... is anyone there who can solve this problem or I should leave the game along with my 1500 friends playing this game,1,2025-09-01 21:21:39
I have videos to prove of the glitches that people are using now. they freeze your game and then once your your two buildings down they unfreeze it and they're throwing out like 30 points. I have multiple videos showing just within the last 15 minutes of four people in a row doing this. this game used to be fun. used to be cool but they're just way too much cheating in it and it's just not worth playing people and they're not trying to fix it,1,2025-09-10 11:59:42
"It's incredible how they manage to break the game, they just pay more for cards.",1,2025-12-10 21:38:20
"Gameplay is very good, but the game itself since a few updates is just 'pay to win'. Honestly your skill level doesn't matter anymore. You can straight up buy yourself huge advantages over other players using your money. And this is not something I will accept in a game that tries to be 'competitive'. I mean I want to compete with my skill, not with my wallet.",1,2023-06-21 21:01:28
Pretty good game. It's fun and uses strategy but is kind of pay to win because when you get high enough you find people with cards that are 3 or 4 arenas up maxed out and then they completely obliterate you.,3,2025-11-27 04:13:53
"Game is pretty fun. 3-5 minute matches. Takes time to learn the cards/combos but a lot of good videos to help. You can pay to level cards faster, but you can't pay to win. There is simply no way to buy skill, timing, or card placement during the matches. Every loss is a learning opportunity and hackers are few and far between. Truthfully, a pretty good way to kill 3-5 minutes.",4,2024-02-07 20:35:32
"This game is very good and fun when it works. Almost every time I load into a match, the game freezes and crashes. Then after about half an hour, I can finally do the things I want to do. I'm playing this on an LG K20. Aside from this relatively large issue, the game is very fun, with charming graphics and excellent multiplayer gameplay. The clans are very useful for connecting with friends too.",3,2021-08-21 22:56:47
this game is very rage inducing. the matchmaking is trash and I'm convinced the game tracks the cards that you lose to and puts you against them. for one of my decks I was contunuisly put against one deck and I always lost then I swapped decks and I have never saw that deck again despite being in the same arena im assuming they do this to make you spend money on the game by making you feel like you have to (you pretty much do),1,2025-11-17 03:07:15
a very stressful fun game but needs to be less pay to win,5,2026-02-12 17:36:21
"Played at launch and it used to be fun, now it's a pay to win mess. I'm done with getting steamrolled by overleveled players who clearly spent tons of money on the game. Even worse now with the extra ""elite"" level to overlevel to, and evolution shards. Pass is also 2x as expensive but rewards are less? Like seriously these guys makes EA looks nice. Only way to enjoy this game for me is to play challenge modes where levels are capped and all cards are free to use. Really dissapointed in Supercell",1,2023-06-28 06:40:12
Worst algorithm in the history of gaming! It is mind blowing how bad it is! If you are not paying to play you won't get past a certain point because they match you to lose more often than not. I have been playing since a couple of months after the game was launched and the more you advance the worse it gets. This is a revised review of this game because it use to be amazing until they became all about pay to win and have done nothing since day one to improve their algorithm.,1,2023-12-07 12:05:38
"I've been playing this game since 2016, only a few months after it came out. I remember I had fun playing it back then and I have considerably less fun playing it now. The developers never listen to what the community wants and just adds terrible updates that just keep getting worse. The game is mostly pay to win with the skill level required to win having been decreased by a LOT the last few years. It still is fun but it would be better if the devs actually cared. Do better.",3,2025-11-21 22:36:45
"I'm super tired of this game. there is no skill, and it's just pay to win now. everyone uses the same deck, and it's like playing the same person over and over. at some point, that gets boring doing the same thing over and over again. then the queuing is also stupid now, too. why am I going against people with way higher trophy counts than me? I'd get like a 30 crown difference, but 100 and even more is absolutely ridiculous 🙄.",1,2025-09-18 19:06:36
I really like this game and it is very fun although if u have low patience I do not recommend my friends have broken many devices to this game,5,2025-12-13 22:30:42
"It wasn't as good as it was before. This game is losing its strategic game title, it's becoming a Pay to Win game. Most players have purchased Royale Pass, and other items that they could benefit from. They have an advantage over the other free players. And one more thing, there are players who had already acquired legendary cards you moved in greater arenas. You shouldn't have moved those cards. Or at least remove the cards of other players who acuired them before. I have hopes for u supercell.",2,2021-06-23 22:21:51
"Fun at times, frustrating at others, and a bit addicting. Grading is due to several changes I've seen over time. I have been playing since day 1 and unfortunately this game grew to become a money sucking machine. Latest updates give you less for a higher price, the chest path UI it's horrible. Now there is an evolution on cards, so PMs are running out of ideas. Lastly there are cards that require some changes. Ex. The hog rider has not been nerfed in years and it's on almost every deck.",1,2023-06-20 01:55:51
"the game is fun but there is way too many instances where players are advantaged, such as more card drops letting them have higher levels more often and now evos which take ages to grind without spending money making the game incredibly pay to win as evos can make cards far too powerful for their elixir cost and cost far too much to defend without evos of your own, thanks to the current dev team the meta may change constantly but a playes debit card will always be the strongest thing",3,2025-10-08 01:01:09
"Hello Supercell Team, I noticed that the Ice Spirit card does not produce any sound effect when deployed on the battlefield, while all other card sounds work normally. This issue has been consistent, and it seems like a bug in the game. Could you please check and fix this in a future update? Thank you for your support and for continuously improving the game. Best regards,",5,2025-08-27 20:44:54
"After many years of playing this game, I can say that it's a great game with not very friendly free to play content. If you want to enjoy a game without paying a dime, you're better off looking elsewhere. This still holds in 2025.",2,2025-11-24 19:03:32
I used to be a big fan of this game until they removed chests. At first it seemed like a good change but what it actually meant was limiting player rewards and making the game almost impossible for a free to play player like myself. If the game fixes the many mistakes that have been made I will come back but for now avoid this game it isn't worth your time.,1,2025-06-04 03:38:07
"Rigged matchmaking to make you win a few rounds to keep playing. Then you're matched with someone who is pay to win. Generally the entire game is pay to win to be real, the hell are these evolutions? it doesn't seem fair to have a cannon that literally fires projectiles all over the arena. Games gone to hell thanks to these evolutions and a hellish amount of people can agree with that. Not to mention the random new troops surfacing left right up down, little prince? The Frankenstein guy? Weird.",1,2025-10-08 16:31:14
"Since last update, I have a permanent ""1"" reminder on the Clan Chat tab saying I have something I haven't clicked on yet, and it never goes away. I have no trades, no cards left to request, and there are no fellow clan mates giving Gold or making requests, or anything like that. Super annoying that it is there telling me I have something I need to review or do, when in fact, there is nothing I can do to make it go away. For most gamers, this is unacceptable. 1 ⭐ until it's removed.",1,2024-05-10 19:37:07
"Love the game. I never really got into CoC but for some reason this game has me hooked on getting new cards and building new strategies. The only drawback is that getting both currency and cards takes so long. It would be nice to be able to unlock extra slots for chests and have all of them opening at once. Even if that was something you could unlock with gems, it would be worthwhile for players to hold on to them rather than just use them to speed up the painfully slow waiting process.",4,2018-10-09 12:56:55
"Not so good game. Too much of Internet connectivity issues. And also Clash Royale only want real money coz it doesn't gives card. Easy way out is to buy it either from real money or gold. Selection of opponents is also unfair. Lower level player gets high level opponents. Hope you improve these concerns. Review after 7 years: After spending thousands on this game, it's Still the same, as long as you pay you will win. Worst game with worst algorithms. Do not waste your time on this game.",1,2023-06-15 17:37:18
"As of late, the game has turned more and more into a literal pay to win type of game. I've played this game since day 1 so I know what I'm talking about. After the quests got removed, the game has gone downhill. I'm giving it a 2/5 because it is still playable (sometimes) but it is REALLY annoying when a level 11 has all maxed out cards for some reason.",2,2021-09-08 20:12:28
Why did you remove connection with Facebook? I have many friends on Facebook that i need to contact with inside the game!!!,5,2026-01-29 21:39:42
The game itself is top tier probably the most enjoyable mobile game I have ever played but if you are free to play you are going to have a tough time progressing. Supercell does not care about the player and just wants to suck your wallets dry. I hate to say it but this company just destroyed my favourite game.( i have been playing this game for 4 years and still does not have a max deck because they keep adding stuff like heroes and level 16 which makes you play at a disadvantage for months),1,2025-11-24 11:20:06
this game is fun and challenging it helps to control Stress but the one thing that has destroyed the game is pay to win about 80% of the items in the shop can be bought with money . In my opinion I have lost interest in this game because of pay2win,3,2025-10-20 20:45:22
"people complain alot about paying to win, but once you hit lvl 15-16 thats not really an option. I love the live events and free emotes that are always given out too 😁",5,2026-01-09 07:48:28
"I use to love this game, been playing since beta. Now it seems the company has really taken its greed factor to a whole new level. One hero card and 5 keys for $20.00? This is some scalping type of pricing, the game has lost its fun. Pay to win for sure. Though who am I kidding, its always been this way. But lately they don't even try to hide it....",1,2022-11-06 13:48:13
"i retried this game after not playing for several years, it used to be an interesting game but sadly unless you're prepared to spend (serious amounts of) money the progression is non existent now and getting to a point where you can compete is simply unattainable. The goalposts seemingly get moved away further and put behind more and more pay walls every update for the 3 months I played after coming back.",1,2025-12-07 04:15:59
"Fun, easy to play and addicting I am disappointed in supercell for adding level 14 cards. It was not necessary other than them trying to be able to get more money from people the rest of the update is good. They could have easily added in champion cards without the extra level. Very greedy. Makes me want to stop playing this game after all the years of playing this game, too bad.",3,2021-10-27 22:39:47
Bad experience add report features and some times elixir speed automatically increase or decrease,1,2026-01-21 20:55:39
"so here's what I think the game is good but pay to win, a level 11 tower with level 14 troops, as a f2p player you can't get evo easily, coc is even fair in many ways than this cow that they are milking and those whales spend 100k if not more just to insta max the cards and why is the game pass so expensive, it may be not expensive in US or other countries expect but rest I don't think they are happy about the price.",1,2025-09-17 00:20:20

"What the hell man..... All the supercell games are crashing as hell. I just updated the game yesterday, and it has crashed like 10 times till now. I've lost all my war attacks due the the crash. Please man fix it good and fix it fast. I've already reported the hay day game. I didn't hear anything back from them. Your customer support is also crashed I presume.",2,2020-04-22 17:09:09
Some people say that the game is pay to win but I do not think its true because I got 10K trophies and a fully maxed out deck in 1 year of gameplay and I have not used any pay to win method at all. To get lvl.15s is hard and I can say that you get it faster when you buy the wild cards because of my friend that plays a fully maxed out lvl.15 deck in Dragons spa. All I'm saying is that the game is not pay to win completely although spending money can help you progress faster the other players.,5,2025-09-29 23:15:19

"Starting today everytime I search for a battle it just keeps searching on and on and won't give me an opponent. Please fix this so I can continue playing! Also the chest wait time is so long and with only four slots you can't really play for a long time. In COC even with all the builders busy you can raid every hour or so. I would suggest lowering the wait time a bit to improve the enjoyment and play of the game. Otherwise it's a great, fun game! I'll give five stats once the issues are fixed!",4,2022-03-30 21:06:08
Addicted. Very fun. So much strategy. Sadly the matchmaking is broken beyond belief unless you pay money to advance quickly. And the experience system doesn't make sense. You get no experience for playing the game. You level up in a very odd way that takes ages for advancement unless you pay. No experience for playing. I have been fighting players a higher level than me since I started playing. No matter how bad they are they win because they have many levels on top of me and do thousands more,2,2022-06-08 23:43:41
"I love the game, however I was not expecting that my account would be fined from a non existing refund. It takes a lot for me to spend on a game.

At this time I'm dropping my 5 * to a 1* till its fixed or till I receive som sort of answer.",1,2021-12-01 08:37:20
"everytime a try this game I feel more and more frustrated, Mega Knight is a plague an the game goes more and more P2W in each update",1,2025-12-27 17:57:14
"I've played this game for a long time but I've had enough. The main concept, cards and mechanics are well made and well executed, but the gameplay is horrible after a while. The matchmaking is rigged- after you win a few games, the system puts you against opponents which are impossible to beat. They are not 'lucky' they have impossible to beat decks compared to your own. Leveling up also becomes slow after a while, unless of course you pay money. Even then you lose. Game's p2w and impossible :|",2,2022-10-10 04:42:00
"The devs really like Firecracker, Hog Rider, Mega Knight, Furnace, Witch, Pekka, log, balloon, lumberjack, princess, and hogs. Just make something up with those and you win. Absolutely 0 creativity. Absolutely 0 replayability. It's meta or die. If you want something FUN, CREATIVE, and repeatable, I'd suggest ""Magic: The Gathering"" (with select friends, it can be just as draining as select combos ruin the game) or, ""Cards, The Universe, And Everything.""",1,2025-10-02 20:08:39

I really miss playing, please can I get help?",3,2025-09-21 09:44:13
Overall the game is the best game. It easy to get into a game and you can trade cards with you clan mates. Sometimes I get a message saying that a chest is open and fifty present of the time it is ready to be opened. Also the most of the cards when you get up to when you get your first lengerdy card they start to cost 5-10 so you just can't spam them. In conclusion I think that it is a very good and fun game to play. Yes there are pros and cons and it is really fun to play,4,2020-03-21 20:35:36
"Ranking systems are trash. If you use a good strategy, it won't matter. they match you with opponents; not based on relative strength. so you're either much stronger, or much weaker than your opponents. This actually discourages people to spend money (which im assuming is the businesses goal). The matchups should be based on mean level of the 8 cards you're using.",1,2025-10-18 03:59:29
"Unfortunately, this game has offered very little new content recently, but they continue to make the casual experience more and more frustrating. The in game purchases continue to rise in price while offering significantly less value. Many of the new content that they do introduce becomes an afterthought just weeks after being released. This most recent update and future ones that have been revealed look to continue these trends, so don't waste your time.",1,2023-03-30 06:13:33

"This game was fun when it started. They keep messing with the cards saying they are unfairly balanced. They aren't. It's the people who don't understand strategy games and how to properly use the cards that's the problem. Now all the cards suck, even witch & bomber skeleton. The new players want it all. They want all maxed out cards but they don't want to work for it. It took me over a year for my first legendary card, and it was the log... Get over it. It's legendary rarity for a reason.",2,2021-10-28 01:29:42
"I'm in Serenity Peak, and after slogging through the majority of this game, I can definitely say this game is NOT worth your time. It's stressful, painful and annoying to try and progress once you reach the mid-game content like Royal Arena and Builder's Workshop. This game has a system in place designed to match you against players you physically can't beat with your deck to try and get you to buy Pass Royale. It's predatory.",1,2022-09-16 20:01:51

The worst game ever. most pay to win game ever. There is no such thing as matchmaking in this game. I am a free to play player and consistently get matched up against significantly higher level players. even if their king tower level is the same it doesnt matter. I've faced people who are king tower level lower than me and they have level 15 cards. Genuinely how can u make a game matchmaking by trophies it just doesnt make sense.

"I was enjoying this game until the newest version was updated. It has this new mechanic where when you place a card either to attack or defend, at the most critical moment your player gets entangled by vines. The frustrating part is that this only ever happens to me. I've never once seen another player get cockblocked so brutally. Yeah, it's a real mood killer. I'm gonna have to uninstall if this keeps on happening",1,2025-09-11 14:43:26
"Not only does the app ask you after every battle to rate it, the chests (which contain cards to better your armies) take an insane amount of time to open. Minimum 3 hrs. You have 5 slots and can open one at a time. Battles are random and you can't skip opponents so if you proceed to quickly your screwed. If you love to spend you money then this is the place.

Support will ignore you and not fix the gane issues. completely unballanced and full of pay to win trolls that purposly drop ranks to just to force certain people to loss. the support is very toxic and this game is extremely toxic with no reporting. you report something and they will just ignore you or say thats not our problem. someone calls you a slur they just ignore it,1,2025-09-11 02:52:05
As many others have said this game is pay to win. Every game I play the other person has cards two higher than my highest. To upgrade cards and unlock the actual full potential of the game you have to spend 100s of dollars. Game mechanics are inconsistent as some cards will target the tower even though it's further away and they aren't building only cards. Don't waste your time with this game. The developers don't care about this game other than making more money off it while they still can,1,2023-07-07 03:34:02

"This is that ""hate it, love it"" type of game. Despite its P2W nature, the game is incredible; from animations, graphics, and to its unique characters and features. It's hard to grind the game but with the right deck for each arena that matches your play style, the game can be fun. Though I do suggest that you don't grind it extensively to avoid being bored or stressed if your on a lose streak. Overall a 7/10 game. It's good, but can be better.",4,2025-07-30 13:09:11
This game used to be good but supercell has gotten greedy and have made the game unplayable to f2p players.,1,2025-12-03 00:48:37
"great game, but I accidentally deleted the game and then I redownloaded it and ever sense the game wouldn't load, soon as I open the game it just kicks me out without saying anything. This has been going on for about 1-2 hours I dont know why or what to do, someone please help!!!",4,2025-10-02 08:24:43
"Although the gameplay and mechanics of this game are really well polished and the games design is very good, the experience of playing it is bad, to say the least. Although they definitely have attempted to improve, balancing the game is still massively unbalanced. generally if you can lose a game too someone who is as skilled or even less skilled than you simply because they happen too have a deck that counters yours perfectly or because they have spent more money on the game. It's not balanced",1,2025-09-27 21:21:08
been playing this game for 9 years and this is the only game this is true for. vibrant rich community with lots of strategy for the expert and casual. Paying will help you advance quicker but there is no ceiling on playing for free if you invest the time it. Major plus.....NO ADS....though lots of in game things to buy if that's your thing. Clans is what really sets this game apart. you can spend 20 min playing or 20 hours...up to you.,5,2025-09-12 05:37:27

"Awesome game! Great gameplay and just good competitive fun! Get this game, you'll be as addicted as I am. 5 stars. Edit: After playing this for a long time, I have to say, the developer updates are nothing but more ways to monetize the game. The latest being the worst case. Now you pay $5 A MONTH! for ""season pass"" and if you don't, your progress is negligible, making you fall behind unbelievably fast compared to players that do purchase it. Disgraceful and greedy.",1,2019-07-13 07:23:08

Its the worst game i have ever played. The best card is the credit card. Imagine you invest 10k in this game. This is what most of my enemys do. Its impossible to win in 60 percent of the games cause your enemy paid more money than you. Only because the game is free in Play store doesnt mean its free ingame. This game is the perfect example why games get worse and worse each year...,1,2025-10-05 22:21:24
"After the last update, there are some problems. When we watch the reply of the game, it ends in a different way. Sometimes it shows like I won early than the actual game and sometimes it shows a late win. Now the game isnt loading at all. It is becoming worst and disaster day by day. Updates making it more worse. The removal of party mode was utterly dissapointing. Now they are only focusing on getting money.",1,2023-11-22 20:54:46
"Wouldn't recommend. An absolute cash grab made to look pretty, only that. You could completely dominate your opponents just by spending money on the game which is absurd. Servers are completely broken and the game lags half the time even when you're connected to excellent wifi. Skill is an extremely small part of the game and most of the time the higher level player with better cards ends up winning the match.",1,2021-02-13 23:47:46

it could be such a good game if not ran by a money hungry doesnt care about their player company its full of p2w overleveled people and f2p players like me get stuck in arenas for a month and half now with no progress because we cant beat a lvl 16 megaknight with my lvl 10 cards in arena 15,1,2025-12-19 21:33:57

"Been playing for years. The game has become entirely pay to win. Huge shame because it used to be such a good game but like others, they've abandoned the fan base that made them, so they can make a few extra bucks. Edit: 1 year later the problem is worse. Evolution (super) cards and (super) towers that either take MONTHS to unlock, or require you to purchase a second level tier of battle pass. Just gross at this point",1,2024-08-06 11:52:01
"Have been playing the game for a while. Initally I really liked the game and had fun with the clan I'm in. However since the release of the new clan wars, I've also lost interest in the game unfortunately. As the clan wars was one of my favorite things to do. I still like the game from time to time but then only for one game and then am done again. Quite sad to see the game going from 5 stars for me to 2..",2,2021-03-26 17:20:58
"Honestly, this game sucks. I used to play this game a lot because it was fun, but now that I look at it, Clash Royale is just a miserable experience. Why is that? It's because of levels. You could have one huge ""push,"" a term used to describe when you put a lot of cards onto offense, but then the next thing you know all your cards are defeated because they are underleveled. Besides, this game promotes sticking to one deck, as that's the deck you'll mainly be using and invest all your cards in.",1,2025-09-15 05:53:42
"This game used to be pretty fun back when I was 7 and I played with my family friend but now, it's just so different. This used to be a slightly competitive, fun, enjoyable game but now with all the magic coins, book of cards, etc. Its really easy to gain certain cards and items that were extremely hard to gain a couple months back. For example, I worked very hard to earn some legendary cards but now, I can easily upgrade my kegendary cards with the book of cards, etc.",3,2021-11-03 16:12:30
"I played it for some time, and enjoyed how balanced the game became. However, over time new characters were introduced that made the game lose this balance, now it's a mixed bag and I don't enjoy playing this game. I tried it again, a few years after leaving it and it's the same, if you use money, you have a higher probability of obtaining characters that give you any unfair advantage. It's pay to with in the long run, and I don't want to be part of a game that follows such a model.",1,2019-04-14 02:57:00
"It is well optimized and functions. My concern lies in that they keep pumping out more and more p2w features and continue to drive player base towards the same cheap strategies and make it impossible to experiment with different types of decks in order to reach top since everyone uses those cheap strategies to wall off any fun and unique playstyles. I am no whinner who cannot ""get good"", this game has just objectively spiraled downward. This has caused me to delete this game and abandon it.",1,2024-06-10 22:23:44
"I love this game but there is one thing in the gameplay. When I deploy a troop is takes 2 full seconds to actually deploy plus 1 second for it to start attacking. This may be a small thing but its really annoying since sometimes I have to defend really fast and the enemy troops are already here, i deploy a troop and even if its a spell like a zap, it takes too long. The Zap is an ""instant"" spell, but while it consumes elixir..... and gets deployed..... takes too long and people cant defend well.",1,2021-04-04 22:02:01
"Used to be a really good, fun, and challenging game many years ago, now it's a pay to win. Progress is not made by winning battles and opening chests, now it's about having to pay for the season pass, pay for upgrades, pay for gems, or pay for gold. Matchmaking is incredibly unbalanced, with players being paired with other players 2 levels ahead of them with fully maxed out cards rather consistently. The only thing that makes this game remotely tolerable for me anymore is the clan I'm in.",1,2022-05-19 18:46:37
"I used to like this game when strategy was actually a part of it! Now all you have to do is spend $5 for ""Pass Royale"" and you basically get unlimited tries to beat everyone! Its ridiculous! No point in playing if there isn't an incentive to get ahead! And also I'm level 11 and I only face level 13s so this game is so stupidly unfair it's ridiculous. Uninstalling!",1,2020-04-03 14:00:34
"New update is much needed, still not enough gold! I'm a level 13 been playing over 4 years and still have only level 11 cards. I always have good stable connection, or using data 5G. The servers of this game desperately needs a update. I'm constantly losing connection and losing thropies and crowns! I think the game has so many people on the servers it weighs down the connection. Overall this is a fun game, still needs a lot of improvements done.",1,2021-06-08 05:23:36
"It's just amazing. But the only problem I find with the game is the tournament matching. Every time I get into a tourney, I get opponents at least an xp level above me. It seems that they do it purpously so that the lower level players can never get the bonuses . If supercell would fix that, this game will be the best on this planet!!!",1,2020-10-08 19:42:43
"Years after my first review, the game had changed in tons of ways. There have been ups and downs, but for the most part, I was able to handle supercell's pay to win antics; however, that has changed. The most recent update introduced clash pass. This literally killed the game for all f2p players. Now, the game is objectively better for those who pay per month, and it's not just gem spammers anymore. On the bright side, their matchmaking system seems to be much more balanced as of recently.",3,2019-11-27 23:45:34
"The game is actually fun to play, however I'm constantly being frozen out in battles, my device is not old yet it seems to bodge when I play sometimes. It wouldn't be a problem if losses weren't a big part of the rewards system, but I'm very bored of logging in, losing unnecessary crowns, and having to spend the day attempting to get back tht which was wrongfully lost. Great game, just not fun losing because of game malfunction. Uninstalled today unfortunately.",2,2022-04-18 13:57:54
"I have played this game since it came out just about and it was a big downhill when you could buy your way into good troops, but now this new update. No sir, that makes it even more unfair. But there are WAY too many glitches and laggy times in game. I have great internet and it'll buffer or knock me back to home screen in the middle of a war battle. Fix the bugs please! Ever since you sold out the game has been super glitchy. I have excellent wifi and it doesn't load right half if the time.",1,2019-01-07 21:26:18
"TWICE, when i went on hog draft race, it crashed. The first time, it was stuck at 81% for a few minutes. The second time, it froze a few moments in. The third time I played, the openent got FAR superior cards to me, but that is a different story. My main concern is that out of three loses, in only one did I even have what was even classable as a chance.",1,2020-09-20 15:45:42
"I can't say there was a time I truly disliked clash royale's core gameplay. I used to play for hours and began in 2019. I loved the micro interactions between cards and learning them all. But recently everything has changed. Level 15, matchmaking, evolutions; even a long time player who maxed season's pass couldn't keep up. I just want to play the decks I leveled years ago, not playing whole months to max one new OP card, just for it to get nerfed after I upgrade it. Uninstalled. I'm done.",2,2024-10-05 09:59:05
"The concept was great. The meta makes things kind of bad, but it's still manageable. The Clan Wars 2 update took things from bad to worse. Now, instead of pouring your heart and soul into getting 8 cards to max level to win, you have to do that to 32! What an absolutely ingenious idea!! Seriously, unless you want to spend lots of money right off the bat, don't download this game. I can literally derive more joy from watching US politics than playing this game.",1,2020-10-01 11:28:46
"I've played this game for years and always had a fun time. However, the latest update is a big money grab. They clearly don't care about the player base. They want you to spend $100 to unlock the four new level 15 cards and then spend another $10 to upgrade a single card. Otherwise the amount of time it will take without paying the steep price will be outrageous. I'm talking months to max a single card from level 14 to 15. Supercell you've failed us yet again. Update: still money driven trash",1,2024-05-15 06:34:25
"I Have played this for several years and really enjoyed the balance between free to play like me and pay to play players. There has and should be a slight advantage to people willing to pay, which is good as it keeps the game in business. Currently, with the huge advantage to level 15 cards with the special ability. All things being equal in terms of skill, deck, etc, the special ability deck will win. I'm in a fairly high level clan but can no longer pull my weight w/o spending time or $.",3,2024-06-01 01:51:23
"Clash Royale advertised their battle pass saying that you can CONTINUE challenges for free. I have had to restart the past two challenges.. Also, 44 gold for winning a battle in multiplayer?! What a joke! I've played this since launch, but I think I'm moving on. I have played For over THREE YEARS and still cannot max my cards. But Supercell won't care about my opinion.",1,2019-07-21 09:38:04
Horrible- so can't tell you how many times the game has crashed at a crucial moment. I have to log back in and am destroyed by the time the game loads again.  Gameplay itself a 5 star but this type of issue in an online game is unacceptable. Free to play style is a 3.5 star. Legendary cards are horribly integrated but everything else is okay.,4,2019-04-16 19:31:29
After playing this game off and on for over 4 years I have learned that everything is fixed. My opponents aren't random or real-time players. My tantrums are mocked all the time so it appears that whomever I am playing is assigned to keep me at a certain level. Upon watching other clan member's elixir speed mine seems to be a lot slower. So I lose a lot because they deploy more cards which put me a disadvantage. There is so many different ways the game beat you. Their cards take more hits.,2,2023-06-17 22:43:34
"I want to like this game. Three years in and there's still something holding me back. The game quickly became more predatory with the in app purchases. The imbalance of cards as you head into the higher stages of legendary arena clearly show this. Progression is halted and you start to only lose battles based on the fact that someone's stats were higher than yours. This game would be great if the devs cared about the player's experience rather than who has the deepest pockets, because I don't.",3,2019-07-24 09:31:32
"The new card level system is garbage, and so is the match making system. I would refrain from making in game purchases. I get it that I should be paired up with others that made in-game purchases, but I shouldn't be paired up with players who are level 12 or 13 with 180+ tower health and 3 maxed out cards, while I'm level 11 and dont even have a single card to the max. Other than that I appreciate how the dev's made it easier to get gold, and i give them props for not making it impossible to get, but thats about it.",2,2018-11-10 08:46:37
"Only problem i have found is the game is a major battery drainer . If they can fix the battery usage, then i will give it 5 stars. They fixed the battery drain issues. Game is great , fun time killer if you have a few minutes or hours to burn. Only problem is it has become a subscription game now. So you can play for free , but be prepared to be destroyed by anyone paying for the game.",4,2019-10-18 12:06:47
"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!! it's completely P2W game. The game is good till arena 4 then it becomes P2W. I am in arena 5 and the players I match against have arena 10 cards, the community is toxic, all the players I match against have overleveled cards. Supercell please fix this. I play Clash of Clan the COC Devs atleast listen the community.. but clsh royale Devs doesn't even bother to listen the community I wish I could give zero stars",1,2026-02-02 00:25:59
To a certain level this game is fun to play. After a reaching to level 8 the game becomes unfair. The match making is effed up. You have to play against players 3 to 4 level advanced than you. And if you don't spend money you will feel stuck to a certain level and the progression becomes so slow that it feels frustrating. Overall I would like to say play as long as its fun and then quit. :P,1,2020-01-11 11:30:18
"Clash royale is an awesome game! I don't like that it is pay to win but this is my go to game when I'm feeling bored! I am a completely f2p player with 15000 trophies and Royal champion league, and the one thing I can say is that its not too hard to progress as long as you play consistently a little everyday. still, the pay to win could be reduced but overall, so many great memories with clash royale. thank you supercell! :)",5,2025-09-18 09:21:06
"I've been playing the game for 8 years, and it's just gotten worse over time. SuperCell has made it a pay to win game in every aspect possible. It completely sucks for players who are just trying to have fun and enjoy the game, and even worse for players who are slightly more competitive and serious about progression. My advice to ya'll don't waste your time downloading the game unless you have enough bank to play.",1,2024-09-19 03:34:13

"PARENTS!! Your kids will waste your money. Most pay to play games are still kind of fun because if you're skilled, you'll be alright without having to buy things to increase your odds of winning. This game is designed to be addictive and force you to buy cards. There is arenas you can get stuck in and HAVE to buy cards to progress. For years (since it's debut) Ive played regularly. I just uninstalled because I've plateaued unless I wait months to years for freebies again. Read other reviews..",1,2024-08-04 11:27:18

"After this update I'll mostly be on standby for this game. 6.99 was already high enough for a monthly pass... now it's 8.50 for a meh version, or 17 for the diamond pass... this game has become the definition of pay to play over a short period of time.. this more or less was the last game I religiously played as it was fun and not entiiiiiirely money grabbing.

"Hi, I want to mention a very pig problem you did after the new update. Forcing players to upgrade non used cards is so annoying. For me it's a waste of gold. I was lvl 10 king, I used to play league and that was pretty funny. Now I can't play both. Why lvl 11? It's not my problem for having low king lvl. I have no reason to open the game, collecting gold to upgrade the cards I don't use is so hard. It's not easy at all. Why am I paying without getting something back?",2,2022-11-17 03:21:40
"I love this game and got all the way up to the second league. Personally, I do not like the idea of having a royale pass that you practically have to pay money for. The tower skins are cool but I wish that they would add them to the shop and just make them cost say, 1000 gems. Also, I play with friends and wish that they kept the game modes like draft battle in the friendly battle menue permanently.",4,2019-10-01 05:01:28
"I have recently returned from about 3 years of not playing. I came back around the Goblin Party event. I loved the event, it was super fun and made me happy to have downloaded the game again. However, after the Update For Losers and finding impossible to play Clan Wars any longer, and now the whole 'Terry' event. It really seems that the devs of this game are absolutely unenthused. I don't want to Uninstall this game again when I've seen how good it can and used to be.",1,2023-06-21 14:38:14
"My game keeps quitting me/crashes out to my desktop when I start playing against another player 100% of the time. I tried fixing all the problems such as reinstalling, Log out of Google ID, correct time and date, all updates are up to date.

"This game has gone downhill, especially since the last update. The price of the pass has gone up, & a new pass added for $11.99/mo, which is outrageous. I used to buy the regular pass every month, I won't be going forward, nor will most of my clan. There are fewer chests awarded now, no chests received for 2v2, and the new event where you earn tokens (daily limit imposed unless you buy the pass) is a waste. You can't buy much with a daily limit and the options are terrible. The game sucks now.",1,2023-04-06 05:10:44

"I played around 4 hours total and could already see just how much they want you to pay for chest unlocks to get card upgrades to help you level up faster. Which is quite literally pay-to-win. I cannot support a game who's greed comes before its supporting player base. The game is nothing without it's players. Unfortunately a lot of players are too ignorant to see this problem. This game has some good potential to be great, but the paywall is massive and unfriendly to new/free to play players.",2,2021-10-21 16:52:08
"For sometime I have been suspicious, but now after years of playing, I finally proved it to myself. The game cheats, and decides who it wants to give a little elixir boost to. I do not know how it decides on that, if it's by region or amount of wins/loses. Finally, the developers seem to decide which cards shine for a time before changing, and then call it ""balancing"", it's nothing balanced about it, just foolishness.",1,2022-10-13 08:58:26

"I truly love Clash Royale as a game but this new update is overwhelmingly disappointing. Raising the level cap to 16, removing Books, and taking away Elite Wild Cards all feel like moves made purely to slow down player progression and push people to spend more money. I understand free-to-play games need to make money, but Supercell made $78 million last month; and apparently that wasn't enough. What this change really does is punish dedicated players who already spent years grinding.",1,2025-11-12 14:29:19
Game is trash! And the creators! Unfairmatchmaking. Would give 0 stars if possible. Been playing game since 2016. Played often and thought that there was a way to EARN you way to the top. NOPE! You have to pay to play to make yourself better at high levels. As well if you choose the wrong cards too upgrade you will hurt your play/ chances to upgrade/ and overall lose a lot of matches.Glad that I wasn't dumb enough to give any money ;),1,2021-09-13 00:56:43
"It used to be my favorite mobile game. I played it right after release, so I was f2p competitive. The amount of cards and strategies is beautiful and so much fun to play around with. The problem is the meta. Once you're in higher arenas (if you're even a bit good), you'll run into meta constantly, and it ruins the creativity to me. Why offer 100+ cards if only 20 are really good.

"I've tried playing this game multiple times, but it's just a cancerous buggy pos game that cares more about mo ey and purchasing your way to the top than balance. screw strategies. they don't matter. you'll be going against people 4 levels above you. you want to do something and be able to climb,spend 100 dollars,or cry because you don't have 900 hours in a Terri Le game getting destroyed. oh y, u want to get something to keep up. no, you need to win to get stuff so there's no catching up. 0star",1,2025-09-07 02:08:24
"The game has fairly improved in a couple of months and is really fun to play, though the only setbacks are difficulty in maxing a card to level 15 and the game being in favor of p2w for fast progression....",4,2025-10-24 03:04:51
"worst game of my entire life. Its pay to win the second you download the game. If you don't pay to win then you won't have fun in this game at all. On top of that, the devs don't balance cards correctly and it leaves cards overpowered for months on end.",1,2025-09-19 08:43:22
"Absolutely horrendous game. The developers will purposefully cut your connection in the middle of a match regardless if your winning or loosing. It's not a connection issue for sure, I've checked and I have almost perfect WiFi. Game is also unbalanced and EXTREMELY pay to win. Like to the point that the game team refuses to listen to the community and will continue to drive this game to the ground with Pay to win features. Don't bother wasting time for this game.",1,2026-01-31 06:21:34
great game I would recommend kind of pay to win but still enjoyable without pay to win and it has great leveling,5,2025-12-10 06:21:17
"Clash Royale was fun to play. However in recent times, it feels really impossible to progress in the game because many people will either have over leveled cards, cards that aren't unlocked for their certain arena yet, evolved cards that have ridiculously overpowered abilities, and it gets frustrating to play at times. Supercell thinks that this problem will be solved by constantly adding cards, but it doesn't. Stay away from clash royale, there are other better games.",1,2024-04-17 16:16:06
This is no doubt a pay to win game. The upgrade towards the high levels are way too expensive. We should have the option of degrading cards and get back a portion of the gold spent when we upgraded the card. The match making algorithm is garbage. You would experience a very frustrating losing streak for no apparent reason. Trophies you patiently worked hard for many days would be gone in just a matter of minutes. This game is not for fun and recreation. Zero stars if I could. 👎👎👎,1,2022-07-30 22:55:05
"Matchmaking is unfair and you will always get stuck at a certain point, always will get matched with someone way higher level than you, its complete pay to win and you will have to do ingame purchases to get good and progress",1,2025-11-09 19:21:58

"I stand behind behind my previous review after coming back and playing for the last 5 years and paying for the pass every month since. The new update is trash. It started with the new matchmaking update, then charging more for the pass. It was already not worth the 5.99 each month but I paid it to keep playing. Now 11.99? Get real. You have in app purchases to help offset your cost of the rising market. Will not continue to play or spend money on this game. WOULD NOT RECOMMENDED.",1,2023-04-03 19:55:53
Used to have a good review from me but supercell has become too greedy. Before you could get a lot of things by playing free. Now they reduced gold from chests and in general the ability to get stuff for free. Now u have a battle pass with 2 options to choose from which are both above 10$ for some small stuff. I have decided to stop playing this game because it just ain't fun anymore. Imagine being level 13 and fighting level 15 pay to play winners it's just not fun.,1,2024-03-21 03:24:06
"more then 7 years play this game , unfortunately the game is created in a way that they make you lose by lagging 0.3 mls enough to not put the hero counter the enemy, is for years they do this so you put more money in and they let you then to win , I don't recommend to take seriously this game because you all will be sad disappointed",1,2025-10-18 18:36:16

"Personally, I find that this game is alright. It brought about a new genre of games altogether and generally revolutionised the gaming scene. Anyway, this game is great in its combat, system, and balancing. However, it falls short of 5* as they took many methods of getting gems and other really convenient functions (ie quests). Also, clan wars sucks :( Good game though.",4,2024-02-22 18:20:03
"I have played this game for 3 years and I bought the pass every month until 2 months ago when it was nerfed. They tripled its price while they were giving less than before. Now, they are adding more levels and they are selling it as if it is going to cost less gold than before. It is needed like 3 times more cards to upgrade 1 card which makes you spend more money. What’s more, they are adding evolutions on the game but the requiered shard are only available in a 15€ pass. It is already dead.",1,2023-06-19 03:28:53
"Incoming updates are terrible for both new players and free players, and they are even bad for paid players as well. When adding a new level (meaning more cards and gold needed), they lowered rewards in the pass that would be needed to do so, even to paid tiers. Paid tier is getting a major downgrade, and the price is being raised. This is a sign for everyone to quit. There should be no fear of missing out. You'll miss nothing by leaving.",1,2023-03-25 23:01:33
"Laggy at crucial moments, as if the game is trying to make you lose. Additionally, high level people crash their trophy level to play in lower tiers, so your perpetually fighting overleveled people and clearly the game has not attempted to solve the issue. Frustrating waste of time, and I regret spending money on this game. Also, the ""strike"" system is super rigged. Whenever you use it to reroll your cards, it always rotates through the same sequence of bad cards in the same order.",2,2020-08-10 04:04:37
"Best game! I'm playing it since day ONE. For those who say that you need to spend money to progress, I spent about $10 in total in 7 years, which I didn't need actually, and I'm still enjoying the updates and I progress consistently while I'm getting all cards, all badges, almost all evolutions, and that's how it is. You need time and consistent gameplay to progress over months/years. This is the business model of casual battle roayle or PvP games.",5,2023-10-23 19:22:58
"I haven't had the game for about a year and a half and when I redownloaded, I can't say I'm really surprised to see nothing's changed. You have lower level players that have WAY better cards from higher levels that have down ranked and it's impossible to win. It's more angering than fun when your towers are knocked down in two seconds and you can't get anything in against your opponent. Disappointing.",1,2019-11-29 13:04:55
The cards that are annoying all have synergy (i.e. megaknight + rocketeer). The game encourages pay-to-win by locking the new OP Evo cards behind a $10 paywall or 3 months of grinding 3 different battle passes. A single card upgrade from lvl 13 to lvl 14 costs 75k in gold and that can take a week or more to accumulate only if you consistently play daily.,2,2025-11-02 01:07:58
"Usually crash without any signals even if the game has a maintenance. I lost more than 300 points for the ""Re-log in"" problem, Very annoying problem, and this is the reason that I have to rate it to 2/5.

It had happened multiple times that I try to enter a battle but it loads really slowly and by the time I enter I see that my opponent won three crowns and the match is over before I could even enter the game.

Poor versioning and requiring force updates at least 3 times last 2 weeks. App crashed and there was no way to recover account. Ridicilous!",2,2018-12-30 08:59:04

"Have been playing this game since it's global launch, it's pretty addictive. The only good thing about the game is it's graphics. This game used to be a fun game but not anymore. Devs aren't paying attention to the cards that needs to be balanced. They're upgrading/balancing the cards that needs no change whatsoever. Skill used to be a major factor while climbing the ladder, but nowdays it depends more on card levels and which cards you have/use. Basically, it's pay to win game.",1,2019-11-01 09:22:43

Their troops and towers will have more health and deal more damage than yours. That is if you're higher up in trophies like I was before I quit.

I am unable to place troops most of the time and have to do it repeatedly.  After one of his princess towers takes damage, the king jumps up like it took damage but stays and begins shooting my troops. Enemy troops will be killed by mine and immediately Respawn with no explanation.

LIKE WHAT and then im struggling over here trying to play a 2 elixir card and the guy is placing another 6 elixir card so the guy has a whole 20 elixir push and i have nothing to play...so its like an ex wife that keeps beating you.,5,2025-08-26 20:10:06
"Pay to win to an insane degree. Card levels, card evolutions, champions, etc. There are so many ways that you can pay to have a competitive advantage, it makes the game so un-fun. They could have monetized their game a thousand different ways, like charging for cosmetics only, but they decided to go the pay to win route. Also, there is basically no strategy in this game apart from making your deck. Once you're actually in a match, the winner is just the one who has a better deck.",1,2024-05-31 03:57:31
still play this game daily but its so pay to win its impossible not to get hardstuck in any given areana no matter your skill level due to people who have multiple levels higher than you in cards and towers edit: still same problem ive also ran into an issue with grinding where the game only incourages you to play 4 games a day because outside of the 4 chests you can get the pass takes forever to get with mid loot and the events are just bad and the game continues to push pay to win to the top,1,2025-09-10 05:55:59
"terrible game, they make it hard to play this game without paying, removed season shop one of the best thing for f2p players because ""it wasn't doing it for most people"" when they still have the trader who is completely useless, this game is horrible if you don't use your credit card, if I could rate this -5 stars I would",1,2025-10-16 08:08:54
"Matchmaking is ridiculous. Essentially, you cannot fight on a leveled playing field unless you have been playing for years or spend hundreds of $$ which will only get you to a even matchup. Extremely not recommended for new players. Would be a great game if it wasnt for the intentional lack of balancing. Edit: Clan Wars 2 is here. They've officially taken out the last thing left in this game that had any real balancing or leveled playing field. They're really just in it for the money now.",1,2020-09-07 01:34:28

The last probably 10 times I've played a multiplayer match my teammate has left. And I'm not allowed to leave until the game I'm playing is over making it extremely frustrating when I want to play another game afterwards.

"I've been playing this game since it launched and I just can't anymore. It's gotten to the point where basically every player runs the same deck or a slight variation of it there's no fun in playing anymore. They need to rebalance a handful of the cards, especially baby dragon, or give them counters to encourage players to use more variety. Plus the new pass has made the pay to win unbearable. It used to be paying gave you an advantage over free but it wasn't near as bad as it has become now.",1,2021-07-08 11:51:43
"This game is really fun to play, and that is the only reason why I'm not giving it a one star, which I'm giving it a two star review because way to often it feels like it's pay to win, or requires serval months of just straight grinding.

"I love this game. Thanks for all of the improvement and new challenges!!! However, the only issue is the match making.

"Clash Royale has become a pay-to-win game, making it frustrating for free players. The introduction of level 16 cards was a bad move, increasing the grind and widening the gap. The game is also rage-inducing due to constant baiting strategies. They've added too much, and the game doesn't feel fun anymore. It's a shame because the core gameplay is still fun.",3,2025-12-07 04:43:35

This is probably one of most difficult game I have ever played and not in a good way. It has some of the worst match macking I have ever seen (Worse than call of duty). I hate how I get put in matches with people who are +3 level higher than me who have way more skill than I do. Another thing is the in-app purchases. They are way to overpriced and should be lowered.,2,2018-10-15 12:26:33

I am changing my 5⭐ to 1⭐. I loved this game and have been playing for over 6 years and recently the game is modified to do good only for people who spend money and buy the royal pass. The matchmaking has also become very unfair and not at all encouraging to play. They only give you hard encounters and it is such that every game you play is designed for you to lose. The gameplay has become very demotivating. Hope the developers read this,1,2023-05-21 20:35:05
"this game is absolutely horrible. this game is paid to win. every match is always a counter to your deck somehow. every game is mostly only payed to win players.

Of course there's the common fool that will say its worth it to pay, but those who don't are immediately at a huge disadvantage and just can't advance too far.

With the introduction of Clan Wars II they finish killing the game. If i could give it 0 stars i would do it. Now im unisntalling the game for ever I downloaded the game again I tried to give it another try but the game still is garbage.

If you're interested in playing Clash Royale I'd highly encourage you to try Null's Royale instead, a private server.

It's often paring me up with past champion level players & i get slaughtered game after game.

Still a fun game at times, but definitely losing the alure & likelyhood of me spending anymore cash.",3,2020-10-21 22:31:02
The game was good about two years ago but since then there has been no innovation. There are 3-4 deck archetypes with a few interchangeable cards. New cards are basically slightly different versions of original cards. They balance cards in a way the prevents creativity. Some of the funnest cards they have created are nerfed into oblivion for fear of a little bit of something different creeping its way into the meta. As a result you get a very stale game.,1,2019-01-13 09:45:00

I enjoy the game and don't want to quit playing it since I been playing it for 7 years now but I'm tired of facing broken cards all the time.

Megaknight really needs a major nerf ever since they gave him and evolution he is just spammed in every match you play. I'm tired of seeing him!!!!!!!!!!!!,1,2025-11-13 04:51:59
"As other players have said, the game is not based on skill at all, instead It's the money you spend. And the battling problem; it sometimes puts you in battle with a player a whole level or two ahead of you, so theyre pretty much unstoppable. The game might as well just have players comparing cards & levels to each other to see whose one's better & higher than letting players battle with overpowered opponents and rage quit. The game is just about plain luck, honestly.",1,2021-11-16 06:53:57

"The game is good but the only problem I am facing nowadays is that it lags so much at the starting.It freezes for sometime whenever we start a new game,which results in losing the game because we aren't able to play any deck or see what's the opponent is playing in the starting.By the time it unfreeze,we've almost lose the game. It's my humble request,please fix this <3",1,2025-09-08 18:18:20
"I have played this game for last 3 years but nowadays this game totally sucks. The loading screen takes several seconds and my opponent gets a head start. A sudden black screen/kickout appears during my battle and I had to restart the game knowing that I lost my trophies. My clanmates also faced the same. The game barely worries about ""Free To Play"" players nowadays. The news tab doesn't even load with a proper connection. I swear I would have given zero star if it was possible.",1,2019-06-17 13:30:06
I really like playing this game until recently. I've brought a chest using gems and the game froze during that time. Now every time I login it's still trying to open the chest and freezes in the same spot. I've emailed the developers and got back an automated message that says to ask for help with the games interface....I'd like to but can't do that if the game freezes every time you load the game.,3,2020-09-02 04:52:41
"Clash royale is really a great game fallen from grace, a game entirely ruined by corporate greed. This game used to really be something special, an extremely unique and charming game, one of the best skill based and strategy games out there. The core gameplay is still there, mostly, but everything else screams ""pay money"", or struggle for what would be years of frustrating progession, in which the keep adding more of. This game just isn't worth picking up, you have better uses for your time",1,2025-04-07 11:35:12
I'd just like to say that the game is a little boring but the new update will change it all and this game is not 'money oriented' but 'skill oriented'. The people who are crying that the high level players overpower the underleveled ones are people who aren't skilled at all. I reached 6000 trophies without a full maxed deck and not having bought pass royale even once so that pretty much answers the question.,5,2025-11-24 23:04:43
The game is becoming very pay-to-win (they are releasing new cards that are extremely strong but are impossible to get unless you spend 40$) also if your cards are under level you instantly lose due to the dmg and hp difference in the cards,1,2025-09-07 05:51:37
it is a really fun game but they give nothing when you get ti the arena 19 and the ppl there are really pay to win and not fair,3,2026-01-22 07:26:17
"Played this game for many years, each year it gets worse. Basically its a money laundry machine. Even if you spend some money, you barely have enough to get a few cards maxed, then a new update drops, max level increases and everyone who spends more money than you do has an edge over you. Latest update with the ""gem economy"", removing books and spamming players with more and more micro transactions screams P2W. Uninstalled it and you should too!",1,2025-11-25 07:36:52
"I've played this game since 2013. Out of all the supercell games I've played in my life, this one is the most disappointing and a blatant cash grab now. It used to be very skill based with each card having specific abilities to counter such card with another, like overwatch. But overtime with the introduction of lvl 15 cards and evolutions, resources are harder to acquire via free to play more than ever. You used to be able to get insane value with the ""battle pass"" for $5. Half that for $12 now",1,2024-03-17 23:55:37

"I have 5 bases that I have bought the monthly pass for religiously for the last year, and with the new changes, I just wanted you guys to know, it will not happen again. The decision to not allow bases to drop trophies past a certain point, currently has my th9 base stuck and unable to progress. Who decided this? Now, I play nobody I have an even somewhat fair chance to beat, and cant drop a bit to get back into fair competition. Dumb. I am finding a new game to give my money to. Thanks.",1,2021-07-20 11:02:42
it's pretty fun until you get to about level 8 and that's when it just gets boring it takes more trophies than you get and 3 trophies away from the next reward and it's like win one more game like just give me 3 trophies extra it's really bad DO NOT INSTALL,2,2025-10-02 21:04:19
"8 Year vetran here. Played the game since day of release I've seen the game though it's high and lows. Even though it has always been pay to win, ever since the evolutions update it's just been terrible. I have not spent a single penny on this game and let me tell you. Battling people with no strategy only money just erases my 8 years of experience and skill. I am not dropping $30 just so I can play at par. Hate to say it but, I'm done with clash. Very dissapointed with this cash grab.",1,2024-04-09 13:55:28
"Game was fun, but they keep adding more cards into the game. Also gold is way too scarce unless you pay real money to get gold. Pay to win. You see level 10s, 11s and 12s with max decks, which should be capped based by king level. $5 a month basically if you want the season pass. Don't waste your time with this game! It's awful!!",1,2022-08-05 09:40:05
"Used to be a great game. Now it's just a frustrating terrible game. Keep matching really strong players against weak ones so we consistently keep losing. Why? Whether you pay or use the free version, the story is the same. You won't progress after a certain point. Imagine matching level 15 with a level 13. How do you go past the stupidity ? I really loved this game, now it's just a waste of time because you'll never progress! Hate the update. It's just bad!",1,2024-10-19 18:32:22

"My previous review was a 5 star, changing it to a 1 star, because there is P2W everywhere. I'm stuck in mid ladder and I just casually see 2 level 15 cards and the rest are either just level 11 or 12. This is probably just a supercell move. You guys are just wanting money instead of fun, and I wonder why you guys care about so much about money.",1,2025-09-07 21:59:56

"Good game.Fun and all. Cards are well balanced. No card is overpowered and without a counter. However, the matchmaking can be sometimes unfair. I'm consistently matched with people 2 or 3 levels above.Also upgrading cards can be tedious especially without a pass although this is cheap. I don't know if it's just my phone but the game freezes and crashes after a few games and I hate that. The cache it makes after a little time is also a lot about 1gb in an hour. Otherwise it's a pretty solid game",4,2020-09-18 01:14:45
"As a way to kill some time and get a quick thrill, it succeeds; however, it's designed to be addictive with its balance of free and paid content, fast adrenaline rushes, and the promise of rewards. Unlike some others of its kind, this incarnation of the pay-or-wait strategy incorporates card collection and special powers, which adds some interest. Yet the entertainment value is fleeting and as frequently frustrating as it is exciting. There are many better fantasy games, better tower-defense ga",4,2022-10-27 18:18:06
"This game is very fun and takes a lot of skill and time. It does however have some issues. The servers are just generally laggy even if you have a good connection, and for a game that requires precise placement and time it is quite frustrating when the servers don't function very well. It is also very much pay to win and it is very easy to get angry when you get put against someone who shouldn't be playing against you. Its a fun game but look out for these things if your considering playing it.",3,2023-02-03 04:34:35
This game is pretty fun with its strategy and gameplay. I just find the matchmaking for the later arenas like arena 14 frustrating. It gets really annoying being paired with players who have lvl 14/13/12 units when you only have lvl 10 units. A unit being higher lvl then you doesn't mean you'll lose immediately. I'm just saying it's annoying to have a clear disadvantage against a decent player. I still give the game a try. I just hope people don't have to fight maxed level units with low ones.,3,2021-11-19 10:47:51
"Really good game overall, I'm on arena 5 now, and honestly I haven't seen any real problem for now. The only ""bad thing"" would be the fact that people in arena 3 manage to get cards like prince, which you're not supposed to have at that point? Please tell me how that happened. Thank you!",4,2025-09-18 01:07:39
I've been playing for years (2016) the game has not evolved in most positive light. The devs are doing a bit too little and are asking too much for my time and money(I've spent less than $10 throughout the years). Evolutions have fundamentally changed the game and progression is grueling slow. The opponent can now have 9 cards essentially while a veteran who doesn't pay money nor grind is stuck with 8. The devs need to reevaluate the balancing of cards and stop being money hungry. Let us enjoy.,3,2023-10-20 21:30:27
"ever since the last update or 2, sometimes the game begins to have some serious performance degradation all of a sudden and my device freezes with no way of getting back in game or doing anything whatsoever. I have to restart my phone whenever this happens. This is extremely annoying when it happens in a clan war game. Another very annoying recent bug is when a unit is selected, sometimes its drop zone is fixed and I can't undo the drop or move it. The game is becoming unplayable...",1,2019-05-11 05:53:13

What was once an enjoyable game with incredible game play has now become a shameless money grab that hurts the players.

"I played this game since its first few months after it's release, and it was great. I enjoyed playing it, but the quality of the game has degraded. There are too many strategies that are unbalanced and should be removed from the game(hog rider and royal giant centered decks). It turns that game into one that is just who can cycle through their deck faster or who can spam the most cards down. It was great, but it's now a shell of it's former self, though it's still a good game nonetheless.",1,2020-09-02 10:00:39
"the latest update is just awful, with the same pace of the game, I started getting much less cards and money, I am forced to enter the battle more often. also, in the battle itself the units became faster than a slingshot in 2 by feel. cards disappeared from inventory. in general, the last update really spoiled the game, discouraging me from playing it",1,2025-04-04 09:05:01
"Downloaded this game when it first came out years ago. Now, in 2025, the game has gotten to the point where you need to pay to progress instead of pay to get an advantage. The initial chest unlocking system has been removed outright and replaced by little boxes that have far fewer cards. It's a shame that I have watched this game go rotten. The gameplay is still fine, but only to do when you're bored.",2,2025-04-16 02:35:43

I have been playing this game for 4 years now, and starting from the bottom is not hard at all the only issue is when you reach high up in trophies.

With that being said, the addition of champions was a HUGE mistake, and is what will forever keep me from rating 5 stars, unless they're actually balanced.

Some of the cards potion levels are to low for strong cards and to high on others. But the 2 on 2 battles are a great idea. But the game has gone downhill since then.

"This game gives a lot of irritation . Requires a high Data connection. Additionally, placing cards takes 1 second extra , which is additional to the deploying time of cards.

"I've been an avid player since the release. I loved this game and everything that went with/into it. Until recently, that is. The incessant updates and ""balances"" implemented destroyed a deck I used for a 8 months. I was very patient leveling the cards up to almost max for the entire deck, but all that time is now wasted, thanks to ""balance"". Now my deck is trash. I know this is just a cheap gimmick to get me to swap decks and buy what I need to level them up faster. No dice, I'm out. I was very hopeful that even though it is a F2P, it wasn't a P2W, but it is.

The time it takes for you to progress is tied to random chance and is greatly limited by very low daily caps. And that is without mentioning the people you will go against.

Game is ok. I've been playing for about 5 days. Would've liked to have waited on the review but the review was being promoted after each battle. Battle mechanics are simple.

Have been playing for years and years also invested money into the game. But I cannot recommend it anymore.

"I've played this game for over four years now... And it *was* probably my favorite game up until mid 2018. Back in the good days, I would spend hours of weeks competing against everyone and climbing trophies. It's a really fantastic setup that kept me hooked for a long time, and its relevance in the Clash-verse. It feels like the constant addition of cards, emotes and features ruined the game aesthetic.

this is by far the worst mobile game ever made and some of you might say oh skill issue buddy but it's really not I could be casually defending and I put down 6 elixir and then he puts down 20 elixir worth of stuff in 2 seconds it doesn't make any sense this game is the pinnacle of one side advantage cause you cannot convince me that my opponents have the same elixir rate as I'd believe pigs can fly before I'd believe that they really need to fix that or else this games gonna die for the 80 time,1,2025-09-01 22:19:50
"The game is a great time killer, but recently it's begun to fall off in playerbase. It's almost impossible to get into a fair clan war, either extremely underleveled or overleveled opponents. Otherwise it's an amazing experience; it's easy to unlock new characters, progression is fairly linear, and the strategies you can implement are nearly infinite. I highly recommend for anyone competitive and into strategy games.",4,2022-10-09 08:36:31
"the core of the game is good enough, the rest is just pay to win garbage. i've been stuck in the same arena for months: whenever im close to a reward i get opponents of a way higher level than me that spent actual money, and when i lose too many times the game puts me against bots with easy-medium difficulty. its an illusion of progression to keep the player play more, making them think they're not good enough at the game, so they have to pay. events are fun and thats about it. uninstalled.",1,2024-01-31 05:20:42
"The new merge tactics is very poorly developed. sometime you lose 3 times and are eliminated, sometimes you lose 1 time and you are eliminated. Recently they added several new units and bonuses like the fire and electric options, but the mages ability to make a bunny only works half of the time, and the electric ability to damage everything doesn't always do damage. Mix these kind of things in with a win/loss system that has no defined rules, and you have a terrible game.",1,2025-10-25 22:43:29
The pay to win is getting out of control able to get evo at early game. Able to buy evo's and buying the pass is a huge advantage for p2w player meanwhile the f2p player's are suffering being under level.

"The game now isn't about strategy anymore but who payed the most to win, The progress when you don't spend money feels extremely slow and the challenges and events aren't worth the amount of work you have to put in. The matchmaking a problem I don't even have to address. A deck with strategy would most likely lose to a deck filled with high elixir cards, if the cards are higher level than yours.

Now more than ever the Game is purposely designed to get you to spend. All I come across is level 13 players with everything maxed out. I miss the days of random battles. The algorithm they use will always find a player with counter cards for your deck. Making it so you win 1 out of 3 times so you're frustrated and pay for more cards so they can just counter your deck. It's predatory and a vicious cycle for players.,1,2021-04-13 21:17:09

"The game is nothing more than pay to play!!! Once you reach the top levels, you are pitted against players with much higher cards... the only way to win at higher levels is to pay to get your cards higher, or wait forever and lose more than you win!

Just another rigged carnival game!!! TOTAL SCAM!!!",1,2022-10-07 03:00:37
Last few updates have completely ruined the feel of the game. The supercell has really dialed up the pay to progress model in this game. There is barely any reason to play for free. Leveling up and trying to get cards leveled up is extremely slow. And you can only get so far before you are facing people who are 2-3 levels higher than you. Simply a waste of time and waste of money. It's quite obvious the only content they add is purposely built to pave the road for more pay to progress.,1,2024-01-16 17:57:33

"They just raised their prices for battle pass and also created a more expensive ""diamond"" pass that features less of the rewards you use to get for a cheaper price.

It keeps getting worse!!!",1,2023-04-04 04:24:40
I loved this game and played it daily for 3 years.  I unlocked chests within a few hours on a regular basis and got maxed main deck because of this. With the most recent update chests will  reset (golden chests in particular) within hours of being unlocked.  This has made me play it far less - which I guess isn't a bad thing. But I'm also far less likely to make another microtransation for season two next month with a broken game. I will update review when this is fixed.,2,2019-07-25 09:16:09
"Was once a fun game. The developers kept adding more and more in order to make a fun game. But as someone who no longer has a budget to upgrade my rewards to a Gold or Platinum track, I feel left behind. The new UI of the pass rewards gives free rewards in between the paid ones, and makes progress towards your next free reward feel draining. The addition of a new card level will mean everyone is grinding away, but I can't say that I have a passion for this game anymore. Too much paywalled junk.",2,2023-06-21 01:41:47
"It's not too bad now, still pay-to-win but it's playable there are now ways to get evolutions which is good but still rare for f2p, glad that they kinda got rid of lucdrops in a way, they're still here obviously but their chests now, good balance changes coming which is really good. #nerfminer",3,2025-09-29 23:16:39

"""Great game, fun addictive, but competitive and social."" I have to change my review. This game will always give the upper hand to those who purchase in game.

if i could give it 0 I would. This is genuinely the most annoying game of this earth considering all the people that have money or all the kids that steal their parents money progress in this game ridiculously fast. fighting in the clan war is disgusting as level7 get put with level 11 or me level 10 put against level 12 or 13 with their cards almost to max just because they spent money. not all of your player base has money to put in a stupid game. and you call it free to play.

"Uninstall! In my opinion really unbalanced. At the beginning it's pretty fun but as soon as you get higher in trophys (I had about 5,1k) you get matched with people with maxed cards. And if you don't wanna spend a lot (leveling cards is incredibly expensive) money it takes forever to level up epic and legendary cards. Supercell has to finance their game, I understand, but it's even frustrating if you spend money. This matches with maxed opponents are not fun anymore.

worst meta play I've seen in a long time the elixir is so inconsistent it's insane 5+7 somehow is 10 when it's not even possible then other cards just being terrible to others honestly the worse experience for free to plays filled with pay 2 win slop honestly I'm surprised this game is popular it is extremely horrible go play another game please this doesn't a player base don't support greedy devs.,1,2025-09-30 09:15:13

"If you don't pay you don't win. I've been a clan leader for three years and everyone in my clan refuses to pay for chests, etc. So we are all stuck at the same level and there is no way to improve without spending money. It can take a year to update a single card because the process is so heavily weighted to p2w. Used to be great, now is just frustrating. They've even introduced a £5 a month scam to get you to spend more money. The people who created the app must live in solid gold houses!",1,2020-08-31 17:02:23
"Used to be really fun, but with each update, it feels like it is getting harder and more oppressive to progress.

"0 stars, this game reset my daily streak at random which was up at 294 and when I tried to to report it to them was instead told that they have ""too many reports at the moment"" so they can't help me with anything. I didn't miss a day and I made sure of it and the fact that they are so unreliable that you can't even ask for help on a problem just shows they can't do their job.",1,2026-01-15 05:12:33

I see this a lot in the reviews, so please do something about it. It became too much a pay to win, it's not funny anymore..it would be better if the game was 5 euro on the store and no need to spend 5 euro minimum each month :v I know that you like to have money but it's not right for kids, they start to get addicted to pay to win.",2,2019-12-25 19:46:23
This game just the shadow what it used to be. Cards are very unbalanced. If you don't buy the lazest evo in the game and then you can barely win matches. If you don't have credit card then you shouldn't play this cuz is the only thing that makes your matches winnable.,1,2025-08-26 16:41:48
this game is so bad with balance changes and releasing cards it is impossible to have a good deck in any metta bcs the release s card that is absolutely broken and it changes the the who metta and it's impossible to play f2p it's just a rly bad company it's just a rly rly rly rly terrible game nothing is fair there is no such thing as an even match it's either u go up against a hard counter 2 games in a row and then the next game u win it just repeats. fix the damn game 😭,1,2025-10-01 09:06:13

"Evolution cards were the worst decision ever created for the free to play player base, these cards eliminate alot of already established counterplay in the game you HAVE TO pay for these evolution cards unless you grind for hundreds of hours to get the 6 shards to unlock the cards. Also the two decks I play with dont even have evo cards available which puts me even at a further disadvantage. I know you want to make money as a company but from a design perspective this sucks.",1,2025-09-23 23:33:00
"This game is fun up until you start to make actual progress. Once you get into the higher trophy leagues and start to do the more challenging event battles the cheating is just out of this world. I've played for a little over 3 years and I haven't had this issue until the recent months, ironically after I saw the fair play junk. I don't know if supercell cares or not but until they fix the cheating the game really is ruined for me.",1,2019-09-02 13:14:31

Why not add a few second timer before we can rush each other? And the matchmaking is horrible! I was patnered with a lvl 8 with lvl 6 troops while my oppnents were 12 with max cards.

"Game-play wise, its good! No exploits glitches or what have you. However, as an individual who has been playing this game for upwards of 3 to 4 years, I have came to the conclusion that Matchmaking RUINS this game. With regards to 2v2s and 1v1s and even challenges; Instead of just playing a random player in your class you seem to get matched up against players that directly have the cards that beat you. All in all, I used to recommend this game. However, grind something else. Itll save you pain.",2,2021-07-31 21:44:25
"This is a great game! I loved playing it at first and it was so satisfying to level up your cards. However, as of lately, the game has been getting a bit stale. The ""new modes"" are just variations of previoua modes, and the modes I actually like only stay temporarily. I hear that there will be a big update soon, but until then it is just same old, same old. I do however love the game, the skill involved with it, and all the different options.

New cards will be introduced, and match-making will pair players who don't spend money on the new card up against players who do. In one mode where only 1/4 decks can POSSIBLY have that card, I've been consistently facing it 50~75% of the time. This defies random chance (aka. bad luck). The game is PURPOSELY designed to be unbalanced and less fun unless you pay.",1,2023-07-16 21:25:04
"This game passed from #2 strategy to just strategy. And there is no longer a strategy. You just play over and over against the same pre-configured decks with high win rate. At this point, I see the first card, and I already know the end.

After thousands of hours you are going to realize that it just frustrates you.",2,2020-05-23 08:07:24
Why is the empress for merge tactics so weak? It costs $20 to unlock and is by far the weakest. Whenever I play her the RNG for cheap units go up the roof and only get 3-4 elixir cost units.

Just a few of them are pay to win being completely broken (like every mobile game) not having skill based match making in clan wars (I've run into people both above and below me).

And it makes sure to give you the hardest opponent right before reaching the next arena which is basically telling you to buy stuff or you lose. For proof?

But, one thing you guys could change is the amount of trophies you get or lose from winning or losing battles. like, if you don't destroy any of the enemies towers, you lose less trophies. Win more if you destroy all twrs",5,2025-10-31 07:09:01
10/2021: down from 5 to 2 stars. They add level 14 and super op champion cards. Cash grab. This is how a great game (that already makes them plenty of money) is destroyed. 12/2023: Matchups are no longer random! For example... I switch to a balloon deck and then my opponent has a balloon deck. This has happened consistently enough to be a clear pattern. My guess is that they've made so many changes recently that they can no longer balance the cards.,2,2023-12-14 00:03:00
The game used to be really fun but the latest update really took a lot of the fun away. They've made it into a must pay to survive game. You're now stuck playing against players who've paid to max out their decks and if you don't pay it'll take FOREVER to max your own. Not worth playing unless you like to spend $$$$. When a game cares more about $$$ than players it's a bad sign.,1,2021-12-28 09:28:02

Therefore, it made some old characters ineffective and worthless and you cannot use them.

"This game is so unfair once you get uo to the ""last"" arena, where it just becomes a series of more arenas. The game just gives you a series of opponents you cant beat, followed by a few that you can, and with how the whole structure of the ranking system works, you'd stay in just about the same exact area you're in, until you get higher levels.

change the system of earned trophies because in matches where you win com three crowns or reigning matches you win+29 and instead in unfair matches where you have higher cards you get -33 trophies and that's somewhat unfair and I'm not saying it because of something I'm passing now it's because it happens all the time and sometimes a bit arta put an exact definitvo of trophies won as +30 every time you win and -30 every time you lose...thanks,4,2025-11-23 15:25:35

The game is a greedy mess. Every game is about atrition and it drags on forever. The shop and progression are set up so you can spend as much money as possible while having as little fun. The battle pass is also worse for free users. They are not even hiding it at this point. Evolutions are just straight up OP and impossible to get if you dont pay or grind.

It's basically a gacha game with duels, the matchmaking is built to make you rage and force you to buy cards to win and feel better, no matter how much you level your cards the matchmaking will as much as possible give you opponents that are either one level above you or have a deck that counters yours, of course you will have easy opponents just often enough to keep you engaged.

The game is full of pay to win mechanics that make it possible for low levels to dominate other players by buying maxed out cards and cheesing their way to what they think is the top.

"this game has gone to the dumps, everything is a cash grab, they are basically trying to force anyone who wants to play to pay money now, they nerfed coins gems chests boxs seasons shop before removing the best ways to get each of them. so f2p is destroyed. new update as of 2025, they are abusing copy right strikes to remove criticism of supercell and ther games completely deleting a yt with 1/2 mill followers and a clash creator of 7 years, along with multiple of channels",1,2025-12-09 01:32:03
"Been playing since launch and while the game has improved over the years it has begun to go downhill. I stopped playing since the update in November. This was when the level cap for arenas were introduced. It's now impossible to progress without spending money. Update: deleting maybe I'll be back in another few years, that's if the game hasn't been shut down by then.",1,2023-03-14 12:35:59
"This is a genuinely good game. In fact I'd say it's one of the greatest mobile games I've ever played. HOWEVER this game, while better than clash of clans, is still a whale black hole. It is designed to make you want to constantly spend money, and it pushes this hard. They are perfectly happy to alienate their core f2p audience so that the few people who either can easily afford to spend and a few thousand doesn't matter to them, or who can't afford it but are vulnerable to addiction etc will.",2,2019-01-26 04:38:26
"I've played this game for around 7 years, I used to love this game. It was fun and really enjoyable...until supercell decided to only go for the money and casted aside their players. Then, they tried to bring back people with evolutions and level 15. It is probably one of the worst ideas yet! Evolutions become overpowered as hell and level 15 is almost impossible to get free to play. Supercell is the Ubisoft of the mobile game genre, It's an utter disappointment to see what this game has become.",2,2023-10-12 08:14:12
"Randomly disconnects mid match. Low level arenas are plagued with high level cards making progression impossible without paid content. Don't waste your time, its a game closer to an addiction than something actually fun.",1,2025-11-26 05:01:18
"Great game, play all the time with my friends and family, also best game to pass the time on a long-haul flights or long drive journeys or to play in your spare time It says their are ads but the only time there is if you want them. No lagging It's a shame you have you have to have wifi - if you didnt need it then it wudve been a five star",4,2019-10-13 06:31:13
"Been playing for 6 years. Simply, the core game is very good. Yeah there are timers, but you can always still play for fun, gold and trophies. Plus 2vs2, frequent challenges, and clan wars, and still very active updates. Very easy to just start, high-quality presentation, everything is clear, music is also really well done. It's just a mobile phone game, but it's so hassle-free to find a good, appealing, interesting battle against someone in about 5 seconds that it's a worthwhile distraction.",5,2021-12-01 00:42:21
get ready to spend a lot of money I guess. unless you are gonna play this game for the next 8 years like I did back in the day.,1,2026-02-04 06:34:36
"I felt like pulling my skin out while playing this game the first few arenas are easy but I kept running into pay to win people although this is a good strategy game i ran into more people with good cards or get out leveled my fix to this is leting people not buy cards and instead let them buy emotes, gems, or coins also a winstreak would look cool",2,2025-11-01 23:36:29
"the only reason this game gets a 3 star is because how pay to win it is, and the increase in hackers is actually crazy, so I'm in Ur average arena 10 game and then this guy at the start of the game just casually drops wizard witch scarmy Valk and barbs right of the bat and if I didn't know that in total is like 22 elixir so that was game, in short supercell do something abt these elixir hackers",3,2025-10-20 23:00:54
"very toxic player base, developers don't care about the players and sees them as cash cows, they blatantly remove content and buff cards that were already a problem. coupled with the fact that it's extremely pay to win and the meta relies on, broken new card that you have to buy shifting the meta, everyone buys it, they nerf it into oblivion. the players are the problem though, they are all mindlessly buying into their scheme spending thousands just so they can nerf it into unplayability again.",1,2025-08-29 03:30:00
"9 years later..... The game is still fun to play, but I don't feel a connection with it like I used to. Now it feels like if you can swipe your debit card, you automatically are good. I missed the grinding you had to do. I also miss the chest. Thats it.",3,2025-08-29 02:32:48
do not recommend if you don't like rage bating a lot this game has one of the worst ideas for the cards of the game.,2,2026-01-07 04:54:33
"the game is fun and entertaining. if you expect to continue to progress let me tell you, it's tough without paying. But, you can still enjoy it without the need to spend real money Edit: game is now pay to win. You can play but level up will take real money. Certain characters are pay to play. This may be the worst update to date.",2,2022-11-04 09:49:10
"I don't understand what your app's problem, it always stops at 75 percent and states that it's updating. I can't play the game for 3 days straight. I have played tons of games and this is the worst system I have ever seen.",1,2025-10-04 21:18:10
"Not only teaches you how to manage elixir and priorities, this game actually requires strategies and prediction. You can't simply win this game just by having good cards. However, pay to win makes this game less entertaining and unfair for players.",3,2025-11-08 17:56:40
"Insanely pay to win, new cards are badly designed and this stupid rock festival whatever is so out of place and the music is so annoying, time to lay down this game for good. After 9 years of playing, it's just been bad update after bad update (mega knight evo, vines, egiant, baby dragon evo, 2.6 cycle etc etc.)",1,2025-10-17 12:12:09
"I keep getting lagged out with the connection symbol. It is not my internet, I already tested and it continues to lag me out. I have to exit the game then go back on as fast as I can, only to find out my opponents have already counter pushed me. That is really annoying and frustrating for someone who has played since 2016 and it never happened to me before. Please fix this Supercell, I play daily and it affects me everyday I play.",3,2021-07-27 13:32:49
"levels can be a huge issue in the game. At the 4.5k - 7.5k trophy mark, being underleveled gives you a big disadvantage if you are level 11-12 going against level 14s. The level gaps define interactions, like if a level 10 log doesn't kill level 14 goblins. If you want to progress at that point, you mostly either pay money or grind hard. It's frustrating to play against overleveled decks that won't deserve to win but come out on top. With level 15 soon, This game doesn't deserve your money.",1,2023-06-19 10:45:22
"SUPERCELL please fix this! Since the ""Pass Royale"" update my games has been crashing all the time. The connection is so slow that it won't even let me play a move and i've already lost the match. Also during drafts i dont even get a chance to choose my cards because the game stuck in 83%. And is not my internet connection because i've checked. I even spent $4.99 on the pass royale and now i'm regreting it.",1,2019-07-05 12:18:31
level 16 and heroes have ruined the game. A good game driven by a studio money hungry company,1,2026-01-13 01:15:38
"Awful matchmaking, eomm on a mobile game is insane. win 2 or 3 in a row, enjoy the next 10 games against p2w players to entice spending to level the playing field when you're against players with towers and units multiple levels higher than yours.",1,2025-09-23 19:25:35
game is pretty chill and its getting way more free to play but every time i try to play merge tactics the game kicks me out and i cant seem to be able to get back on the game until the merge tactics match has ended.,4,2025-11-04 16:10:27
"Amazing game. However, it's kinda pay to win, now. Also, recently, whenever I try to go onto the game, it doesn't work. I keep waiting, and waiting, but the screen just says 'Updating' I waited half an hour for it to work, but no success. I restarted my phone, reinstalled the app, tried everything, but it still doesn't work.",2,2024-09-01 01:40:22
Great game just fix the sound that peka says when you place him down he says mega knight in pekas voice,5,2026-01-18 04:40:10
"Don't even consider playing, at first it may seem fun and climbing the ladder is easy but very soon after you see how much this game is pay to win. The card levels play a big part in if you are going to win because one level will decide if a goblin barrel takes 2 or more shots or if you troops are on par with theirs. Theirs also a lot of balancing issues even though the game had been out for years. The meta also never changes and has stayed the same for a long time",1,2021-12-06 02:54:58
I would like to actually give a 0 star rating as Supper Cell do not give any assistance regarding help needed urgently. They are pathetic with service the support system does not work and now I have lost 9 Years of playing Clash Royale as my account got hacked and I was seeking assistance in order to restore it. 12k trophies gone down the drain. If this is how one is supposed to keep the people happy it's not working. I do not recommend any person to download a supercell game.,1,2025-10-16 16:58:31
In the beginning it was the best game I had ever played on my phone. Now though connection during just about every game is terrible. Sometimes the game doesn't even load. It could be that I just have a bad phone. But honestly I've played it on worse and done better. Not to mention that this game is getting far to expensive for my blood. If you want anything good you can wait a few months or buy it...,2,2019-10-17 21:32:48
"wtaf is merge mode on? cards are randomly drawn sure, but the chances of getting what you need seem to be predetermined before you even start your first match. then when you think you'll be smart and trade in your pieces, the RNG so conveniently decides to draw all the cards you just traded in.... I could setup a bot that would just play, as long as I keep playing my score will always go up... regardless of however many matches I lose.",2,2025-10-23 16:46:57
"I like the game but the developers have strangely decided to foster a culture of extreme toxicity and bming so they can make money selling bm emotes.....very toxic, I can't see anyone sensitive playing, the game is full of haters and misogynists. (also they are a pay to win game, I have payed each season for 2+ years and still havn't maxed my decks, this is WAY more than the cost of a AAA pc game). tl:dr- play a decent PC game, this isn't worth it. edit: 2025 wow it's worse than ever 0 stars",1,2026-01-24 14:04:21
"I think this game could use some large mass arena, or like a huge battle field like team deathmatch, I just think the diffrent modes with events in them ain't enough for my any more, but thats me and so far I do love the game. Its iconic with great character, but honestly I hate when somebody uses an overpowered push and I counter they just give up. I don't really care if nobody reads this. Just keep up the good work its a great game.",4,2024-01-14 07:00:41
"Ive been playing this game for 4 years now, and i think its been really fun. What really sucks now is that they added lvl 16 AND heroes? whats the point of champions now? there def ruining this game, and it sucks.",3,2025-11-26 07:35:05
"I had review at 5 star but I've realized the whole system of leveling cards, opening crates for more cards, leveling them up( which I enjoy), really doesn't matter in most of the game. most of the game is leveled off anyway Until they add a 2v2 where u can actually use the cards that u put all your effort into, it won't feel as fun for me, I understand balancing issues, but add a mode where people can choose balanced, or leveled.",1,2024-06-22 04:40:46
The game is overall fun. But there's this match making problem. I would always be matched with someone who's a level or even 2 levels a head of me. How am I supposed to win? This game is fun but this problem is ruining the experience. I would rate this 5 stars but the match making problem caused me to loose so much. It's obvious it's kind of biased. Please fix this. I'm already loosing interest in the game. Thank you.,3,2020-04-20 15:50:11
"Deck building game with some fun mechanics and quick gameplay. But make no mistake, until you have all level 13 cards it's pay to win. No matter how good you are you will hit a point where your opponents have an average deck of cards 2-3 levels higher than yours and they will win with just brute force. It also feels like it's nearing the end where they've designed themselves into a hole. Upping the max card level gives higher players something to work towards but it's just more grinding.",3,2021-10-28 00:36:16
been playing since release. disappointed with game balance since people have been coming back. I get it. a company has to make money but this is beyond greedy,1,2025-12-16 22:11:52
amazing game always loved it but owners killed it with heroes and pay ro win😞,4,2026-02-06 17:10:56
"The game was around a 3.5 but with this newest update that brings level 15 cards, it has plummeted to a 1 out of 5 which I believe is fair considering the huge shift from a ""pay to win"" game that does try to help ""free to play"" players have a chance to compete, to a totally pay to win monetization system. The Battlepass was a good help when it was $5 a month, now it's twice that if you want to get everything the battlepass has to offer, i think the first game with a 3 purchase tier battlepass.",1,2023-06-21 01:07:08
yeah so far so good game l love play everyday untill last update it just become pay to win now you can just use gems to upgrade cards before this update everything go great clash royale or more like pay royale meet opponents that have lvl 16 card get overleveld this game just become actual PAY TO WIN,1,2025-11-25 13:31:49
"The game keeps crashing since the new update. I was able too play it for a few days but now it doesn't even start up. I do enjoy playing the game (even though i dont agree with what happened with the trade tokens). So could you please fix this so i can give you for stars. You lost the one star, because you probably won't fix it before the next Brawl Stars challenge ends. I was really looking forward to it.",2,2018-12-13 14:54:37
Game is fun but customer service and any aid with an accidental purchase is nonexistent in my experience thus far. even a simple card exchange for accidental purchases would he better than what's currently offered.,2,2025-10-03 10:10:19
"The worst game in terms of support and providing assistance. They do not respond to messages and do not communicate with players to solve their problems. A supporter needs support in order to respond to customers or pay money in order to solve a problem you face within the game. The worst company you can fall into the trap of assistance and support service. There are no solutions, no help, no solution to your problem, just a lot of nonsense. Very, very bad experience.",1,2025-09-04 06:32:40
This game is a master class on how to destroy a game and alienate your fan base in a single update. Heroes + lvl 16 turn the game from semi p2w to fully p2w,1,2025-12-08 03:12:41
It's an ok game been playing for a month. Very slow to progress to higher level unless you want to unleash on the pay to play scale. The matching system really sucks plus the chests you obtain you really should have a choice on what you want otherwise you will be mostly disappointed 3 stars. Lots of better more friendly options out there so uninstalling but wanted to leave a review.,3,2018-12-02 17:49:57
"absolutely horrible game, devs say they have fair matchmaking but as soon as you take a specific card out of your deck every player you play against has a card you cant counter because you took a card out of your deck. Example, evo executioner player here, in every deck I use. However as soon as I try a fun deck without executioner, boom! 15 log bait decks, skeleton barrel mirror clone and goblin barrel clone. horrible game, dont play",1,2025-11-16 05:38:53
great strategy game have been playing for a while but why is it so pay to win and who decided that there should be heros noon wants them please remove them supercell,3,2026-02-06 03:45:20
"This game really became disappointing. I enjoyed playing this game during the first two years, the matchmaking was great, but now I'm getting paired with higher levels then me. No matter what kind of strategy is in use I can't even use them because of the players high level. At one point in the game I got ten loss in row just because I was only getting paired with higher levels.😭",1,2022-08-07 16:24:47
"Strongest card in the game is your credit card. You won't exit an arena while being paired up with people a king tower 2 levels higher than yours. And if by some miracle you win, the next opponent is no better. Unless you have money to spend this game certainly doesn't welcome you. Hell, they even removed the shop which f2p heavily relied on just to encourage us to spend money. Skill or not, you aren't beating somebody with evolved level 15 Megaknight with a level 11 mini pekka even on defense.",1,2025-11-02 19:34:37
it is a very competitive game with lot of ways to reach to ylthe top,5,2026-01-31 16:17:16
its a amazing game honestly. just peak this is my very informative review.,5,2026-02-12 05:38:02
I haven't touched the game in two years. I started up again and honestly I'm in a purgatory. It's unbalanced at all. I'm fighting lvl 11s with maxed out cards and troops and I'm level 10 troops level 11. It went from a game that could kill sometime and have fun to a painful grind of regret and sorrow. Honestly it's depressing. However my opinion won't be taken into consideration but I wanted to give the vets who haven't touched this game in about 2-3 years a warning of don't bother.,1,2020-11-20 02:06:17
the game really good i agre bit why why they make this evo cards level 16 and heros they make it pay to win the game was so good but after ts make it hard to pkay the game isnt fair who pay more win realy??,1,2026-02-13 18:11:46
"Great game, except this last season and the cost to play is ridiculous. Also, what genius decided it would be a good idea to make war decks uneditable after we play? That's when it's fresh in my mind that I'd like to edit a deck, please fix that. Secondly charging $12.99 a month for any type of pass should be criminal. Match making needs and over haul.",2,2023-05-12 00:08:20
"not fun anymore. everyone plays evo credit card and wins. Boss bandit spam Bridge Pekka mega knight and the rest 1 elixir cards. Ts bullcr@p is in every match. Not even enjoying matches anymore. All toxic, no skill left.",1,2026-01-28 22:38:41
"this game has great potential. But some of the characters are overpowered. I also suspect sometimes the game slows down the Elixir production speed for some players. I've measured and have noticed inconsistent times. some characters have excessive strength and when coupled with increased Elixir time makes this game very frustrating. I've uninstalled this game five times wanting to give it one more chance, but this time I'm done",3,2019-05-08 19:26:21
"Great fun for 5 minutes at a time... Or more. If you are complaining about level it is because the rest of us have been playing for years. Grind it out like the rest of us. I have a ton of max cards and have spent very little money. If you feel like you have to ""catch up"" then spend it. The clash team has made an amazing balance between grind to play and pay to play. Better than most games!! I would like to see a maximum level difference of 1.5 that would calm all the complaints. 🤔👍",4,2022-03-31 00:27:15
"I know no one will see this review, but whatever. I've been playing this game for 6 YEARS and let me say; this game has devolved. The core gameplay is amazing. One of the best mobile games out there. Amazing strategy with well made cards. The only problem is in the most recent days, SuperCell has encouraged paying real money to get an advantage. When a new card releases, it's broken. You can max level it by buying it, It gets nerfed, a new card releases, it's broken. Rinse and repeat.",3,2024-05-02 21:27:37
A fun game but is be coming very pay to win.,4,2026-02-05 05:37:27
"Don't download this game unless u plan on putting money into it. It is very much a ""pay to play"" game. The higher u get in the game the easier it is to see that. It is NOT a free to play friendly game. Also clan wars suck! It almost seems like they purposely give you terrible cards to use every time. The game lags a lot resulting sometimes in a loss. Also it will crash from time to time which will definitely result in a loss. Legendary cards are near impossible to come by. I've been playing for over a year and I still don't have all the legendaries. You will constantly get the same cards instead of cards you need. The new emotes are kinda cool but u have to pay for them. So free to play players can't access them. They are constantly nerfing the good cards and buffing the bad ones. Not downloading this game is ur best bet.",1,2018-09-20 12:53:32
"Its fun as long as you are ok with slow progression. If you play this game 12 hours a day you'll only progress slightly faster than someone who spends 30 minutes a day. The game itself is great, theres a lot of cool strategies to test, but if you're someone who likes to get everything unlocked in a week and move on your going to have a bad time.",4,2023-03-27 09:27:24

Good game bad company; would not recommend unless you are willing to spend real life money. This game is HEAVILY pay to win. Every corner you look at has p2w aspects even in a casual duels meant to have players on the most even playing field has ways to get advantages with broken cards released monthly only obtainable through the pass or grinding 1-2 months to get it in which it’s likely nerfed. In the trophy road you often play against people who spend real life money with higher level cards...,1,2025-11-12 19:17:26
"Game was good before but now it's almost entirely pay to win, and matchmaking isn't fair at all, you will be placed against opponents twice your level and with cards that you can only get at that level by paying real money. I've been playing this game for 6 years so I know what I am talking about. If you don't spend you dont win. simple as that",1,2023-10-16 20:30:30
"Clash Royale is a pretty good strategy game. It has a great graphics along with good gameplay. The battle algorithm is quite good too. But I am not so satisfied with the controls. It runs slow on 1 GB RAM smartphones. Plus, it charges highly on mobile data. Supercell should put the whole game in a 90 megabyte package. I had another problem when playing it on PC via bluestacks and Gameloop. It faces problems and a lot of lagging. So, supercell should also create a PC version of this game.",4,2020-08-30 22:24:39
This game could have been so much better then what it's become. The wars are absolutely oppressing. Not having the ability to select when to start them and who to put in them has lead to burnout. If your clan isn't active enough to finish in the first 2 or 3 days then you end up only having 1 or 2 days off from needing to war. I've been leading a clan for well over 3 years now and this boat race war update killed it. People don't want to have to play so often. Come up with a better system.,2,2021-02-23 08:53:02
"I literally lost a match because the game froze, so I reset the app and by the time I load into the match I was a second away from losing. Supercell needs to have a system where you can report a loss where you had no say in.",2,2025-10-12 11:48:40
"Great game turned into P2W trash. I loved Clash Royale at the start, but as you progress through the game, which takes a long time, more time is needed to even have a chance against opponents. The current state of the game requires money to be on an even playing field with others, not to mention absurd prices for offers. $140 for evolution shards, you can't tell me this isn't P2W.",1,2024-07-05 01:29:18
"Long time now, the devs have been getting more and more greedy and ruining the game with each update. Ever since the Clan Wars 2 update the game has been turning into a p2w mess, which pretty much made me stop caring for the game. At the beginning it was fine, but card evolutions, emotes locked behind pay walls, banners just being a thing and premium stuff pretty much being required just ruined every fun aspect. It used to be a fun game. Now it's not. Wanna guess why? Read from the beginning.",1,2023-08-03 07:24:11
"Game is good but needs a revamp or new content Update 11/15/21 A handful of new characters were added along with a few modes but the maps are boring. There's no effort into making them unique. There's no gameplay change. They actually made the game much easier to progress which was a terrible thing. All in all the game is good but it's stale and in need of a major update to revamp the levels, make them interactive or less static, more unique.",4,2021-11-15 20:07:09
Game is good to a point. It is addictive. However you will only get so far without paying. If you don't pay matching system changes when get high enough. This games matching system and elixir throttle are completely BS. I spend money on games after I play them for a bit to see what their about. Would never spend money on this one. Unless your one of their YouTubers it's not worth it. Scam to get you to back one of their creators also.,1,2023-10-26 21:40:57
"2 stars purely because of the fact that litte rats can come from 6 arenas higher with their good card and slaughter you. here's how you fix that problem. if you get knocked down an arena, you can't use a card from higher arenas. FIXED. Literally wouldn't have that issue at all. such a simple fix yet never implemented.",2,2025-09-26 06:21:01
"The game is great, I play it as often as I have breaks...which is a lot! However, since the recent update, I have notice that some of my cards have been 'replaced or better yet...removed. Almost lime some of my progress has been removed. Cards I had, I no longer have. Please fix. Over a year now, and still waiting for some sort of reply/response from the developers. It's clear they are working on the game, as there are updates. But at the same time, clear they read the comment. Typical.",2,2019-05-04 14:04:59
"This game is a lot fun and strategic. But sometimes I just can't log in! I mean I can't enter the game, even if I can enter the game I face so LAG that it is the same as not entering it. For this thing I even lost the Sudden Death Tournament, it was my last chance! I even checked my internet it was totally working right I could even watch YouTube a lot smoothly, So plz fix this!",2,2021-01-10 13:13:03
"This game has always been a pay-to-win game. It's definitely possible to get good playing free-to-play, as I am free-to-play and have gotten very high on ladder and high levek cards. However that doesn't stop people from paying their weekly paychecks to get max level cards before they should. The balancing team (team behind making cards fair/not overpowered or underpowered) are out of their minds. The new battle pass is stupid as well. Avoid this game if you can. I could go on but 500 limit.",1,2019-07-01 21:57:31

"this is the worst game of all time, some cards need a nerf but instaed of this you go and nerf a weak card and adding level 16 to the game is a good way to make money from players right?I'm changing my openion when you add good balance changing and add a level cap, I hope you don't add level 17 soon",1,2025-12-26 19:16:26
The game itself is lots of fun! I've been playing it for a long time but recently it has been horrible getting matched against people 2 to 3 crown levels higher than me. On top of that the game has really become a pay to win. How am I supposed to even just compete with someone who is 2-3 leves higher than me and their cards are way stronger than mine. Fix that issue and the game is easily a 5 star game.,1,2020-10-11 20:16:30
worst game in the world. Pay to win no1 game.No any fair between players.Developers intention is to make more money not to make game better.,1,2026-01-04 22:04:38
extremely pay to win and update quality just gets worse and worse. A waste of time supporting a game that doesn't respect the players,1,2026-02-04 14:54:54
What's up with getting paired up with opponents that are 2 levels higher all the time. I dont stand a chance. Ever since they started the subscription for battle chests. I now only play until I lose 2 games in a row which is usually my first 2 games. If the game lets me win then I win. If I lose 2 then no point in continuing to play. I don't stand a chance with the nonstop mismatching of levels. Either its rigged or their matching algorithm sucks. Finally deleted this game. Its annoying.,1,2020-07-25 11:28:49
"I am now editing my previous review, as there have been some updates since my last review. The game has made some great progress over the years. However, one issue that really bothers me is that every time I use an emote after finishing a battle, the game crashes. Other than this issue, the game is great, and I give it a solid 4 stars. Very entertaining, competitive, and encourages outside-the-box thinking. Overall, very good.",4,2020-09-10 11:47:30

"EXTREMELY PAY TO WIN; don't think about trying to reach the top without spending at least 100s of dollars bc of the horrible progression, the cards are annoying, and also is home to one of the most toxic communities. I have played this game from the start(Month after global launch) and I can see that the game's enjoyment is declining. The silver lining is that Supercell is now giving free items, although the people who bought them are not getting their money refunded, so bear this in mind.",2,2024-06-12 11:26:43
"Started playing this game in middle school and loved it, decided to redownload about a month ago. The amount of pay to win mechanics they've implemented is overwhelming. Constantly fighting players who have spent $ much to level their cards. I absolutely regret picking it up again. I would recommend that no one plays this garbage unless you're willing to drop $200+ on the game. Sad to see how low they've sunk to keep it alive. Seems like it's the new norm nowadays. Would give 0 starts if I could",1,2024-12-07 06:02:34
"bored to tears of this game, who thinks of these games, it's the worst type of grindy game, that wants to hook you into buying upgrades, this is a tax on kids, $900 million and counting, don't waste your money you will get to a level where you can't progress any further so don't start it in the first place, problem solved, constantly matching me against op opponents makes it impossible to progress, upgrade process of troops is biblically slow, 2 days is all I could stand, deleted.",1,2019-06-20 05:45:39

"Absolutely DO NOT PLAY. The ""vanilla"" experience is agony due to the ridiculous amount of cards available, making it so that anything you play 70% of the time you will be queued up against someone with the perfect counter to it. And this isn't even tapping into the constant release of new, more overpowered cards. The only way i see this game being worth playing even minutes at a time is if they add a ""Do not want to play against decks with theese cards"" section with at least 20 card blacklists",1,2024-08-17 06:49:22
"This game is an overcomplicated version of rock-paper-scissors, where luck often outweighs skill. Starting hands and matchups largely determine outcomes, leaving little room for strategy. My experience with Supercell’s support was disappointing—I spent two hours resolving a purchase issue, only to receive an apology and no compensation, not even a token gesture. Overall, the randomness and poor support make it frustrating. I wouldn't recommend it, even as a quick bathroom distraction",1,2025-01-15 00:45:07
"The basic concept of the game, GREAT. Elite gameplay and wide range of cards to choose. I gave it a 1 star because the people who spend money on the game have a massive benefit above those who don't. I find that quite unfair. In the beginning everyone starts on the same level but later on you'll find yourself at a high arena only being King level 7 and all the people who you battle against are KL 8 and above. With troop level far higher than yours. So yeah good game but nah I'm good.",1,2022-06-25 05:35:42

"Once you start out its pretty easy. But once you make it to some of the higher levels you get consistently put in games with people and max levels who get bonuses which make them almost impossible to defeat. You get put in game after game with harassing you down to lower levels. This is a game for people who want to large amounts of their time sucked up, then slap in the face for not spending money to get to the highest level and make you feel bad cause it harasses you to losing game after game.",1,2020-04-20 05:20:44
Would've been five stars if it didn't keep closing / not working in matches and matches only; whenever I place the gaint snowball it closes and I subsequently lose the match. This is gappening WAY too often. (I'm not arena 8 and don't/ can't get the giant snowball yet and I get it in drafts or clan wars.) Otherwise a very good and tatical game which I recommend getting. It's nice how (rarely) you can get a good deal (eg: two legendary chests for £2!) Also make the trainer difficultly optional!,4,2019-02-21 22:10:09
"Yeah so the match up algorithm for 1 vs 1 is getting worse all the time, it wasn't ever this bad before. Before, you would lose and win and lose and win but now it feels like you just lose hundreds of trophies and instead of making no progress, it's like negative progress. I've been playing for over 3 years too, and I don't think I'm so bad that I should be dropping from 5600 trophies to almost 5300 in one sitting.",3,2020-01-06 02:01:27
"Used to play 10 years ago, havent plaued in five so decided to redownload, the whole card system was hundreds of times better before. Not to mention my account was reset to zero for some reason when I spent years on that account. Honestly disgusting. Not to mention the fact that you dont get chests anymore for doing battles? What? That was the only reason to keep playing because that was how you progressed. To any returning players, save yourself the time and dont waste a minute on this game.",1,2025-06-25 16:47:40
"Because this ia an international format, i can't even abuse these guys. The game is the best (in the start) it gets highly addictive you struggle and play with the perfect strategy but, afterwards it matches you with higher level opponents and they have very very high level late game cards. You cant even play it without spending money. But if you do spend money then the game gets better and you get special items that help a lot and the match making is also the best",1,2022-12-23 02:55:31
for the first time I hated this game especially the last update on merge tactics u round it its okay for lvl 16 some people like they had nothing to do but eco sage sooooooo unfair 5 lvl 3 cards with one hit brooo!!,2,2026-01-27 03:13:39
"It's good overall, but it can be a rage baiting game, as this game is filled with pay to win users. As a free to play, my hardest challenge is to go against pay to wins, they are way too hard to go against.

"I come back from time to time, and it's still a cash grab game. It's fun, but at the same time the players can be atrocious to play against. The matchmaking intentionally sets you up to lose via your opponent and stacking your deck against you. Followed by balance might as well have been taken outback and been shot in the head given all the new gimmicks they added that are behind a pay wall mostly. If you got a credit card to burn then go for it, if not don't expect to get far.",1,2025-02-28 11:51:21
"New updates have made a good game completely unreasonable and pay to win. For 12 dollars you can buy a battlepass that gives you access to things dedicated players spend literal years getting to. Makes it impossible to get trophies. Also, the removal of party mode got rid of the only stress free part of this game. Not only are people buying their way up, but the devs made it so much more difficult to get anywhere without spending crazy amounts of money.",1,2023-04-08 08:14:41

"RIP Clash Royal. Newly branded Crash Royale. The new update was what I feared...Pay to play instead of play for free. I appreciate supercell aren't a charity and need to make their money somehow, but £4.99/$4.99 for a season pass is just unnecessarily extortionate. Also, the lag, fps and server speed has become painfully slow making the game, in many cases, unplayable. What a shame, this was my favourite game to play for the past 3 years... time to take up chess",1,2019-07-08 03:18:21
"I have been playing this game since it released. I love this game. It's truly fun, but, we should be getting matched against players with the same card level. I'm level 11 and every time I get Matched against a level 12 or 13 player, its an automatic loss. My level 10/11 cards can't compete against their 12/13 cards. (Edit 2021): The same thing continues. I'm level 11, and I get paired against level 12 and 13 Players. The difference in card level is too much. Automatic loss.",1,2021-01-11 11:04:40
"Worst game ever. It is a HUGE money grabber. Every game past arena 7 is full of people using extremely high tier cards, I'm talking about level 15 items while meanwhile you're not even a high enough arena to unlock it. This game LOVES to make people pay 2 win. Whenever I load into a match there is people using champions while those don't even unlock for another 8 arenas. Worst game ever. But sometimes it can be fun. Only if you win though.",1,2025-10-08 08:27:56
"It's kinda good.... Update: The devs keep adding more levels and making the game feel extremely repetitive rather than adding more things for progression. They also seems to be making the game more pay-to-win. I used to play this game a lot but the recent updates made the the worse and I might quit. If you are a new player, I recommend you that you stay away from the game if you are a casual free-to-play player.",1,2023-07-01 16:20:42

Also extremely annoying meta and overalla bad experience.",1,2023-07-02 02:05:10
"With the introduction of the pass Royale, this has essentially become a play to win game. Before you could either work hard and build up your cards or spend a decent amount of money and buy some boxes, both a relatively fair way to level up. The pass Royale has introduced a way for people to significantly increase their card level for the small small fee of $8. Before I might come across a person with all level 13 cards once every 5/6 games, now it's every second game.",1,2019-10-20 23:35:49

"Sorry guys, I had to see if other users felt the same. I had given 5 stars when this game first came out, due to its simplicity and same characters as CoC, but Wow has it changed from my last gameplays, I would say too much!

"Its a great game to begin with, however, it would take years to reach the final level, unless your willing to spend real money on it. Basically once you hit level 10, the progression system becomes 'pay to win'. Also if you're exceptionally good at this game you basically get punished by being teamed up with opponents a much higher level than you, which is no fun at all. I quit the game at level 10 due to constantly being teamed up with level 13's, which is extremely unbalanced and unfair.",3,2018-12-28 13:20:40
"My first review being back in October 2018, I really enjoyed this game alot. Ive played it through and through.. but Im just no longer into it, Same repetitive story, Theres not much truly ""competetive"" play as it all just feels the same. Ive reached as far as I can go to 5000 Trophies, But after that, with cards being added slower then LoL adds champions, I lost interest, I hope supercell can come up with more game ideas in the future, But I'm afraid this is it for me.",3,2019-01-25 14:02:41

"this is a great game bogged down by an insane ""card""system. By having a level up system on cards that is hyper expensive, it encourages you to just play the same old cards over and over. if you want to try out new cards, too bad. because they are under leveled and you will get your äss handed to you. the Macro (not micro) transactions are INSANE. I dont mind paying 5€-10€ every once in a while, but even spending 50€ gives you next to nothing in this game. why cant i buy what i want?",3,2019-07-01 20:11:10
horrible pay to win garbage after losing 6 times in a row to over leveled enemies with toxic emotes I'm done.

great game overall but I do have a few complaints first: why did supercell remove ranked?it was certainly more enjoyable then the new tactics game mode and now you have to get 15000 trophies to unlock ranked and this makes the game alot more competitive rather than casual second: it is actually extremely difficult to get 6 Evo shards for one card especially if you are above 9000 trophies since ladder is so difficult and because of this you can't complete the Royal pass Thanks,4,2025-11-25 14:36:23

P2W is unbearable don't even play this game unless you want to lose your mind. Hair-countering toxic bots are are huge problem. Little IPad kids are no skilled and annoying. Play something like Limbus company if you want your time and money valued.,1,2026-01-02 07:33:07

the game mode merge tactics is so unfair. some cards like the Knight or spear goblin are balanced while cards like bandit and royal ghost are so overpowered. aswell as this units like battle ram are completely unplayable due to there being so many counters and the fact that you are essentialy forced to use all evo and champion/ hero slots or you will be at a disadvantage ruins the possiblility for decks that dont include evos and champions/ heros.,1,2025-12-21 05:50:02

Update: Same horrible play. I think it's safe to say it actually got worse since my first review and according to most reviews it appears they don't care. Pay or lose 6/2/18I get to level 5 or 6 and the game crashes and will not launch. Each time it crashes I lose all progress and have to start all over. Extremely annoying.

Pay to win Update it's not only a pay-to-win. From a player that has played since it started and leveled up a certain amount of cards and those cards basically become meaningless because of a single patch you basically wasted time playing this game. Because all of your progress was meaningless. By the time you're smart enough to realize you can go online and find good decks to build you would have already invested so much resources in the other cards it would be meaningless.,1,2021-04-21 00:47:26
"At first it was okay, but late-game, your credit card becomes the strongest card in the game. It takes a long time for chests to unlock, which gives you cards, which you need to upgrade your unit's level.

Furthermore, you have to constantly fight people who would normally lose to you, had their cards not been at the max level. Overall, really hard to get max level cards, so 2 stars.",2,2021-05-28 00:19:08
"Edited review as I watched the game fall off. The consistent addition of new levels, op cards, etc made the game a living hell for anyone with a life who doesn't want to spend money. You're almost forced to spend upwards to 1000$ (rough calculation to max out if you already have a mid-range account, might be higher) to be able to get past the slippery slope and actually reach a competitive level. Asides from that you'll always be on a unfair playing field with terrible and toxic tryhard players.",1,2024-07-10 05:06:23
"Fun, addictive, technically solid tug-of-war game, at least for the first few days. Then you hit a massive grind-or-pay wall, because cards costs increase exponentially every level. You'll also need to increase your payments exponentially. There's no honest purchase option (e.g. unlock all cards for X money), you can only pay for consumables, which doesn't give you an idea how much you'll need to pay in the future. Don't fall for predatory monetisation schemes. Buy honest games, where you get the full experience after paying up.

Way to kill a game! Single player lags more than it ever used to.. However It's currently stuck on ""updating""... 4hrs and counting!! do I can't play anyway. Maybe when it finally updates, it will be playable again. It's time to move on I guess...",1,2019-10-07 19:28:31
it's so laggy at times I'll start a match and it will lag not allowing me to place troops while the other guy can and destroys two of my towers before I can place a troop to fight back besides the awful lag it's a good game.,3,2025-11-17 19:33:17
"I have been playing for several years now. Supercell has done a lot lately. None for the better. I am changing my review to 1 star and uninstalling. The past 2 seasons, the matchmaking is broken. It's almost impossible to win. The clan war did get boring, but thenew system is horrid. Again it's virtually impossible to win. People then get discouraged and don't participate. Not worth it as it is today. Find another game.",1,2021-01-05 12:23:41
"The game is pay 2 win, but isn't even that bad. I have been playing for 7 yrs(lost lots of accounts) and its fine but ngl lvl 15 was their one mistake, and before you point out lvl 15 is p2w, Im at 8500 f2p with 2 level 15s. but slowly the game balancing is becoming worse and worse",3,2025-08-24 02:40:04
horrible. only makes changes for the pro players so if you start be ready for the same megaknight spam until 15k trophies. its repetitive and honestly just boring. no point to play devs dont care about the normal players so its become so PTP at mid later with megaknight and firecracker being spamed in the shop as a money grab for all the mid later players. all they care about is money. games gonna die soon because they wont fix mid later. Just sad.,1,2025-10-04 23:16:04
"This game is great it can really rile you up but you feel good when you win but the biggest tip when you lose at least 5 or 6 times you should give the game a break for an hour or 2, but supercell could you guys maybe bring a shop to buy evo shards or something but make them cost around 500 gems or if its coins make it like 250,000 to 500,000 or other spells that would be cool and maybe stuff like that but with other spells so p2w and f2w I reckon that would be a really cool idea.",4,2025-11-09 03:22:49
Edit : evolutions and lvl 15 ruined the game I have always been close to max account but taking a few months off and recently updates set me way to far behind. Old review: Been playing since launch. Over a year! Still can't put it down! No Ads and free to play players can climb to the top! Even better than clash of clans and so creative. I don't know how yall did it,2,2023-08-26 21:46:23
"No matter how much time and money you put into this game, they will just continue to increase the max level on things you spent all that time upgrading instead of adding new things. You can spend thousands of dollars and a decade maxing everything out, and they will just increase the max. All they want to do is squeeze money out of players who have spent hundreds and years on the game.",1,2023-05-19 03:46:53
"Unbalanced. It's fun until it's not. It's a pay to win game . It also need some type of rank system based on troops rank not trophy count. Until the game does that I don't think it will be a really good game till these changes are made. Maybe one day this will be a good game, but I doubt it since it's a massive cash grab. The game has a 2 tier system monthly pass. If you don't buy it, the game punishes you. There is also a problem with elixir distribution and service.Worst game in the app store.",1,2023-08-15 01:09:18
Pay to win trash game. New update makes the game even more pay to win. You can NOT play this game as a free to play gamer. Do NOT waste your time playing this game. It will only harm your mentall health.,1,2025-11-22 19:34:15
The shuffling of the card is the key to win the game. So if they want you to loose the shuffle won't be in your favour. This game has already set it's statistics. If you try to go over the set parameters of the trophy they'll set a match against your anti deck or there will be bug or there will be connection error. So no matter how good you play you can't cross the limit of trophies which is set by them for you. That sucks and developers you also suck. New Updates sucks. It's total waste of time,1,2022-10-24 16:27:41
I use to love playing this game but lately it just seems like the matchmaking is off. Its redicioulos how any AI system you play always seems to have any card to counter the deck. You may have tons of cards to choose from but usually have to choose only a select number of cards in order to compete. Getting stronger cards is absolutely pointless. Game is still trash.,1,2021-12-20 11:42:11
"This game is a nasty pay to win. Balance is a joke, evolutions are broken and insanely overpriced (14€ each). You can unlock 1 every 3 months without paying. But the worst thing is that matchmaking is blatantly rigged. Win streak means you'll get paired with counter decks. What counter decks? Those with cards you have the most loss rate against. Absolutely disgusting matchmaking and monetization for what is an amazing concept of a game.",1,2025-09-18 04:44:58
"Unfairness at its best. Opponent selection based only on trophies. Is it my fault that I have more trophies so I have to fight level high players with more upgraded army?? Sometimes it feels like we're programmed to loose like the opponent elixir fills fast but we have to wait doing nothing. I lost count the no of times I uninstalled and reinstalled the game coz of frustration. IMPORTANT: IF YOU WANT TO RELAX, RELEASE SOME STRESS AND TAKE A BREAK. DON'T PLAY THIS GAME.",1,2021-07-01 21:17:12
"The Game is very Pay-2-Win. My son has became morbidly obese because of this game. he keeps saying ""DAD IM PUSHING MEDALS GET OUT OF MY ROOM"".",1,2026-01-31 10:21:37
"With each update the game is getting bad but then came the update of the 'evoluations' after which it has become dead. Now, only if you pay money for it, you have a chance to climb the ladder which is otherwise very impossible and frustrating. I remember the time when it used to be fun. No wonder now people don't play this.",1,2024-04-05 22:37:57
"What I think after opening a chest: Wow, that was underwhelming. At least I can actually play the game again. Seriously, if you want to progress in the game, you need to level up your cards. How do you get those cards? Open a chest every 3+ hours for no guaranteed card in your deck. This means that if you want a reward for PLAYING THE GAME, you have to wait 3+ hours(unless your willing to throw gems(money) at the game). The actual gameplay is pretty good, if not a little infuriating in itself",2,2019-04-14 01:13:04
Basically they just want to try to get as much money out if you as possible. Yea I'm sure if you want to play this game for years without spending money you might actually get some max level cards but you'll spend most of your time frustrated that people just have max level everything somehow in the lower trophy range(lower levels of play) Basically they dont care about balance and try to get you to spend a bunch to be competitive.,2,2019-10-16 16:30:37
"Once you reach level 10, do not expect to make much progress for a year or two. Unless of course, you spend money for a ""boost"". Very fun and addicting game, but if you spend $200 up to level 10, expect to fork out another 200 to get somewhat close to your goal. It is an example of loot boxes from other various games. Yes you may find a really good deck, but once you get past the next leauge prepare to shell out some more money before you progress again. Their target is gambling addiction.",3,2019-07-27 23:11:12
if there was in minus i would have given that as this greedy individual has just wanted to suck out money and give you nothing in return he has made this game completely worse for f2p players and I had played it sing 2019 and now is the worst version of it and even the matchmaking is rigged I would love to see him suffer as much as we suffered.,1,2025-08-31 17:38:15
"Horrendous gaming experience. This game has obliterated the peace of mind I once had. I've lost count of the many times this game has found a way for me to completely lose it, just cuz of the horrendous matchmaking and the obnoxious community it has built. The developers don't seem to care about the state of the game as long as they keep making money, so you shouldn't GAF about it either. Do something better with your life and move on from playing this atrocity of a game. 1/5 won't recommend.",1,2023-05-29 12:11:24
Now they are just trying to take advantage of you. New pass for $12 and the rewards are less then before. For $12 you better add 5 magic coins & 5 book of books. Greedy CO**SUC**RS. Boring...It's the same thing over & over. Everyone goes online searches the best decks & thats it. t's always 1 of 3 possibilities. No one has an original thought they just copy each other. New cards released are few & far between.,1,2023-04-03 22:10:13
The games too pay to win which makes matchmaking unfun and unfair.,1,2026-02-09 22:03:07
"WARNING!!! THIS GAME IS A PAY-TO-WIN CASH GRAB. Unless you want to fork over literal years to this game you're going to have to pay money. Not just a couple dollars here and there, they're asking for 20$+ in some cases. Some shop offers even 40$+. recently the company has been sending notifications and emails to people encouraging them to spend more money in this game. Any of super cells other games would give you a much better experience without even having to spend a dime. Don't play this.",1,2023-07-30 05:20:34
"The concept is amazing, but the game just feels like who is willing to sacrifice any morals to win, with the amount of cheap and unfair combos it's no longer a game I would recommend anyone plays if they want to have fun, the only time I ever have fun is with the draft game mode when it comes out, which still sucks when you or the opponent gets a broken card. Also recommend preventing players from fighting opponents way higher levels, I'm lvl 11 and don't enjoy fighting lvl13 or 14.",1,2022-03-28 00:15:04
"The newest update has ruined the game. I have been playing for the better half of a decade, and the game has never sucked worse than now. Every trophy road / path of legends is a draft, can't even use your decks. They up'd the price of the Royal pass, and instead of adding stuff for the increase in price, they took stuff away. Pretty much done with this game !",1,2023-04-05 08:35:26
"You shouldn't consistently face people 2 levels higher than you. 80% of my losses are from playing opponents who are higher level than me. Now that I'm at 5000+ trophies I get matched against a level 13 every other match. Trophies shouldn't be the only thing considered when matchmaking. EDIT: After making this review I played some more and decided to try out the party mode, capture the mortar. I'm level 11 and got placed against a level 13 9 times in a row. Your matchmaking sucks supercell",1,2021-06-07 22:28:51
"An extremely UNFAIR and PAY TO WIN game. After you progress a lot, the game will ban you and ask you to pay money to lift the ban. After you lift the ban, the game will send an email requesting money for a copyright fine, which includes something you clearly didn't do. Deleted this nonsense. Also the game always gives certain YouTubers bot opponents to promote the game. Purposely disconnects certain people when they are winning to keep noobs happy or when you about to hit a milestone",1,2025-10-20 18:12:45
"I always return to this game, I farm out cards, take a break, always enjoyed it, I welcomed the addition of the pass. They keep adding more asks and ways to spend money, creating more problems which can be solved with money, more things that can be accelerated with money. Now there is a pass on top of your pass behind which is hidden a new way to upgrade cards. It's moving away from a game towards a pay to win simulator. I am dissapointed because it's a really enjoyable game.",1,2023-10-01 17:39:33

"Been playing this game since 2016, never have I felt that this game has become more and more of a cash grab. This coming from a max-level player, they don't allow enough ways to progress quickly through card levels and you can't unlock any good cards now until you get to high trophy arenas. Unless they fix the game and change the current ""credit-card-meta"" then I will leave my former 5 Star review, as a 1 star.",1,2023-04-13 06:05:55

"Although I love this game I would have to give this four stars because sometimes you fight individuals who are in a higher level and have maxed out cards while you have level 11 cards. Thats a huge L. Also paying makes your life easier but i didnt really and im in challanger 3. The system is broken, but im still playing even though its been 3-4 years.

"Unbalanced Royale is a better name for it Update: instead of balancing things for the better, let's completely change things up to make even less sense. Still 0/5 game. Progression is next to 0 after you hit king tower 7, unless you buy the $5/mo 'subscription'. If you do, you'll accumulate a significant amount of gold to upgrade troops, buy multiple legendaries from the shop, and get trade tokens to swap larger amount of cards around.

I also get so much lag I can't open chests and it kicked me out of the game again it does the same thing when upgrading stuff. EDIT: now I can't even get into a match without lagging out of it.

You can only save four rewards at a time. Cards and in game currency, take an eternity to collect, probably 30 years or more. Any incentive they offer, gives you nothing as contents of chests are not guaranteed, matchmaking is so poor, clan wars are so poor, you lose 95% of the time.Or you could pay thousands to get a very slight gain.",1,2020-11-21 21:32:39

Supercell does absolutely nothing to prevent/fix this or, at the very least, for you to report these players. Makes the game not fun when you face someone hacking who can put down a cost 6, 7,4, 2 another 7 card like nothing while you barely can play a cost 4 and 5 card at the same time and forced to wait.",1,2025-08-21 00:07:55
"No one who works on the development team for this game has ever played this game. Balance changes rarely make sense, and calling this a ""strategy"" game is a stretch at best when each game inevitably comes down to invincible spell cards with no counter play.

Started out good. Then got problems after problems. Contact the help line and nothing was done about it other then shutting me down on convos. This is the 3rd device now I have gotten because they tell me it was my device that had the problem. I now have a galaxy A50 with 4 gigs of ram with quad core and still not much better. It takes for ever to load a game a lot of the times. The other thing I have found is the game is not evenly matched in battles. Other then that it's highly addictive.,2,2019-11-29 13:01:53

"Matchmaking is broken. I either get opponents two king tower levels above me, with cards around two levels above anything I have, or opponents with decks perfectly matched to mine. Occasionally I might be on the other end of this and get a ridiculously easy opponent who gets the same treatment as I did above. What I don't see that often is an opponent who is evenly matched to me, either in king/card level or in deck layout. It seems the game is tilted in favor of those who want to spend a bunch of money to level up their cards. Otherwise, there's no progress to be made. I'd be willing to pay a subscription fee of a couple of bucks per month if it would break this cycle where those who pay the most succeed the most.

I keep being paired against players who are stronger than me. You have a fair play section to players and parents and what you experience in the game is the exact opposite. I figured there were people just paying to level up so I purchased a royal pass and since it's been legit impossible to win any sort of battle including the ones you get unlimited play for.

"Can be a fun game. Game has been out for years now. So anyone playing for awhile should have max leveled cards. If you don't have max leveled cards, you are in for a rough time. It can take years of monthly rewards to get 8 cards maxed. Wouldn't be so bad if there was better match making. I took a break awhile back but decided to rejoin. Since I haven't been playing I was low on the trophies. Being matched up against low levels was very unfair for my opponent.",3,2022-06-27 22:31:31
"The new pass royale system is crazy, $4.99 was a perfect attention-grabbing price point and had decent value to it. The pass royale was the only thing I would spend my money on in CRL. This new system makes spending money not worth it anymore thus making the game less enjoyable overall. I hope you can take the word of me and many other players' into consideration. Thank you.",1,2023-04-07 14:05:08
"This game sucks to the point where I dont even know what the point of it is anymore. It isn't fun to play, the new stuff coming were super hit or miss, the new evolutions get craziness amd crazier making you have to spend money to stay in the same level as others. The same stuff that has been said for years at this point. It will never change and it's gonna be a weird day when it finally goes away. It's not even satisfying to see it not work. Cause I've known how good this game can be.",1,2025-02-19 02:29:38
"Loved this game have played almost everyday for over 3 years. But the updates are getting so that the game battles to load and by the time I get into battle it freezes and I've already lost the battle. And now I even get a 1hour penalty if I exit the game while it's frozen. And more, a recent updated have changed my favorite card the barbs to a bunch of clowns that just can't make it to the towers. Useless! So from 4/5 star rating I'll drop to 1. Sorry supercell but it really sucks now.",1,2019-03-20 12:16:05
This game used to be fun now it's all PAY TO WIN. TERRIBLE GAME AND LOST ALL ITS PASSION. Meeting under lvled player with lvl 14-15 troops after arena 20. Horrid rewards that only keep giving you coins and not cards. Trade tokens are just there being idle and no longer attainable. 1/10 Experince. FIX YOUR GAME,1,2025-09-26 15:31:49
"The core game is neat. It's a straight real time Strategy tower defense. There are a lot of units, the graphics are amazing and the experience is smooth. That would make for a good game, if super cell wasn't the greediest company ever. I've been playing for months, actively, and I can't even touch higher level players. The rift between payers and non payers is beyond laughable, it's entirely pay to win. What's more, they actively imbalance the game to force you to buy stuff to stay competitive.",2,2019-10-18 03:27:52

"I've been playing for quite a while now. We have been through many upgrades, but still no real improvements. The games play match has become a HUGE disappointment. Too many times have I seen weaker characters take out stronger ones. I find myself playing less and less, more so now only to help my clan win wars. If it wasn't for them I would probably quit playing altogether.",1,2020-12-26 05:59:09

It's better to close the app and wait for it to open rather than loosing games to people with higher level cards. Not a very well designed game, pay to win, and it rewards free to play players for not playing at all.",1,2022-06-27 22:52:00

"I've played this game since it was released, and I was a huge fan! I loved playing 2v2 battles with my battle deck that I've worked hard on building and upgrading for the last 3+ years. It was FUN. Since this last update, it isn't fun anymore, it's HARD. I barely win any 2v2 battles anymore, which is very frustrating to me. I've worked hard for a long time to upgrade my battle deck to what it is, and now it feels like that work was for nothing because I keep losing. Please change it back!",1,2019-10-10 03:47:25
"As a player of this game for 7 years, and have put my hours and work into getting better and getting up in the ladder. I can say once this game used to be fun, but now leveling cards is a awful grind for f2p and even worse with each raise of the level cap. With balancing going out the window and the inability to have any variety in your deck or play style, for if u don't have all your cards to at least the same as your opponent you are at a great disadvantage.",1,2023-06-20 12:35:01
"I have been playing this game since release. The battle pass felt fair, and i even purchaced it on occasion. HOWEVER. The last year has been nothing but horrible updates, blatant disregard for the player base, and one money grab after another. I LOVED this game, but I would not recommend this game to anyone anymore. They gutted the battle pass and trippled the price. They keep adding levels despite no one wanting more levels, and they refuse to balance cards that have been problematic for MONTHS",1,2023-06-18 01:23:48
"Since the crashing issue has been foxed, I am now happy to give this game 5 stars. The graphics are simple, though quite charming. The controls are very simple and easy to learn. The game does have microtransactions, and though they do speed up progress, I don't think they give you a significant advantage over F2P players like myself. Updates are consistent and new content and events are being added all the time. Definitely pick this one up if you've never tried it.",5,2019-04-30 19:27:47
"This was a wonderful, yet challenging, game. Especially the recent update has made it a completely pay to win game. I was angry and while back since I had 4k trophies and an update made it to where I needed 5k trophies to be done with the arena. I don't remember what it was called. That made me stop playing for around two years. I tried it again yesterday and I feel like this game is hopeless. I mean honestly now we have level locked characters? All in all, I most likely won't be playing again.",2,2021-12-25 12:03:44
Game was really fun and I felt like my money and value balanced. With the updates and how much it cost to level to 15. I can no longer spend. Moving away from competitive play and log on once a week for Clan battles. Not exciting getting out spent. Will take 5 years to max again. I don't have time for that. Sorry CR. Lost me.,2,2023-07-15 20:15:14

"This last update is awful, you get the season pass badge everywhere, not just in the store. It feels like an app with ads (Btw, I hate apps with ads).

Clash Royale has progressively become more and more money hungry over the years. There has been a decrease in playability that has followed the rise of costs for in game purchases. The main deal that Clash Royale has is a monthly subscription that gives features that are new and completely changed the balance of the game with how over powered they often are. It is impossible for free to play accounts to keep up because the meta is constantly shifting because the devs want you to spend money.,1,2025-12-05 22:31:46
"Apparently the higher ups changed and the game started selling out. They make super op stuff baiting people to buy them, then nerf them to the ground. Sometimes it's acceptable, when it's a choice. However, those op stuffs last for a season at a time, and lately have become a requirement to rank up. Pay to win is fine, when you can win for free reasonably, but at this point, it has become a rotten apple. I still play it because the game itself is fun, but man, stuff they are adding is killing it",1,2024-04-25 21:33:46
"this game used to be fun and very entertaining but for some reason now when I play a match I seem to go against people with unlimited amount of elixir. They always have enough drop a Peka, a witch, hog rider and the prince when I can only play a mini Peka. Not worth playing anymore",1,2025-08-29 02:14:50
"I've been playing for a long time off and on but only as of recently has it become pretty insane especially if I don't buy the diamond pass. First, there's an insane amount of people that are constantly leaving the matches and there is no way to report this. Also why am I getting matched with people with troops 2-3 levels higher than me!! It makes no sense and I'm set up for failure every time. I'm beginning to hate this game.. it's sad because it was my favorite 😔",2,2025-03-08 06:32:01
"I've been playing since clash royale first came out. The game is nothing like what it used to be. It has been becoming more pay to win over time, which was alright but the most recent update has went too far. They made progression 50% harder and have put in offers with starting price tags of $50 plus. Don't download this game, and if you do, don't pay for the ludicrously priced features that they almost make mandatory.",1,2025-04-23 07:12:45
"Game is far less enjoyable than it used to be, that is because now there are so many characters with different abilities that a strong element of luck is needed that your deck has the right characteristics to have a good battle with opposing deck. In the past far more skill was needed and the game although frustrating at times really hooked you in. The game already had a good revenue stream, its pure greed of the developers. The long term enjoyment of the game is gone.",1,2020-12-07 22:19:11
"Clash is one of the greatest mobile games ever made and supercell ruined it with greed. The game is in a sad state and only looks to be getting worse. Between game breaking evos and facing players 2-3 lvls higher than me consistently, its impossible to climb trophies without spending more money than modern triple a games cost.

I playing this game less than 30 min now! Basically you should at least pay 14 15 euro (not sure) per month to be able to keep up with the game and it's awful.",1,2024-07-10 16:26:15
Had to update my review! The game was fun and enjoyed playing. It was the type of game where you could participate with your clan but was not really required to have fun if you clan had less reliable players. That has all changed now. River race has ruined the game. You now depend on your clan mates to be active. The independent play is not satisfying on it's own. I loved the old version the new sucks!!! Be warned.,1,2020-09-08 00:20:07
"Was fun. I played 6 years. Spent hundreds of $ and more hours than I care to imagine. They added champions and I dealt with it and even defended their choices, but now they've added evolutions and level 15. It's pay to win, it's unbalanced and horribly repetitive. Was once great. I've sent emails to devs, tried to convey what I'm sure most of you will get from these reviews, but they've killed the game. I can't imagine why they've done this, but I'm done.",1,2023-07-24 10:26:46
"Pretty good but I feel the a lot of people would like it if there was a perk only for those who go ""free to play"". Maybe after a certain amount of time. So that way even if I don't have money to ""pay to win"" u can still enjoy having some sort of leaverage or something that the ""pay to winners"" aren't getting. Of course the ""pay to winners"" still get their money's worth but I feel it would be a good thing to keep the free players active longer.",4,2021-05-30 12:36:46

"The game was already lowkey dead and broken, but after the update it's now fully underground dead. Totally atrocious decisions made. Forgetting everything else, removing the chests wasn't ideal-they were major for progressing, and for those with max decks, collecting rare ones was fun. Now they're fully gone. There's nothing to look forward to or enjoy anymore. I'll still play for the nostalgia, but it won't be the same unless something changes.",1,2025-04-08 05:26:08

"Frustrating, annoying and ultimately dull game. The initial period of play is great, advancement is fast with lots of prizes and incentives along the way. Once this initial period is over progression becomes exceptionally slow or not at all. Your forces are improved randomly so playing the game doesn't mean it will get any better. Spending money only providers more random enhancements you're likely not to want. So playing means getting beaten endlessly by players avoiding the plateau, poor.",1,2019-11-12 16:58:20

Just sad in my opinion. Brind the chests back",1,2025-04-24 08:36:23

There were always these little microtransactions, but they were predominantly for speeding up your progress and getting more cards to upgrade your deck.

"In old time was a great game but now a total garbage the opponent level how tf do this matchmaking happens my king level is 11 and I get freakin 13 opponents in clan wars and trophies like what do you think I should do when their cards are 15 and mine are 12 my all elixir is wasted defending their one card and they drop 2 more😡,at the very least do it so the opponent's king level can be only a single level higher then we have the chance to beat them",1,2025-10-27 21:07:02
"This takes card game to another level. While it is not fully like solitaire or spades, the card aspect really fits in well with the game. I love the gameplay, the visuals are on point, and the different places and levels you can reach is amazing. One problem for me is how much this makes me hate and love the game. When I win, I get like 28 trophies, but when I lose I lose 26 trophies, it's like they don't want me to succeed. But either way I love this game and if you love strategy, you will too",5,2022-03-30 22:45:05
"Another great game from Supercell, been playing on and off since game was released and it's come a long way. Beware extremely addictive. The players who spend most money have a massive advantage and it's not possible to keep up with them if you're a free player. That being said if it wasn't for those who pay we couldn't play for free . Note If you do want to pay n play it's quite expensive.",3,2023-12-13 22:16:58
"It is impressive how well super cell makes this game the most braindead pay to win game on the app store, never listening to community feed back, raising prices, nerfing lower level players, encouraging a lack of Creativity and instead pushing a toxic meta that hasn't changed in years. The only thing that motives this company is money and how to get every dime out of your pocket.",1,2025-09-01 08:43:42
"This game is great, the graphcis are nice, and gentle, and the concept, and overall time while playing the game is enjoyable. But i do not recommend it to anyone who is new. The games ranking system works with trophies that are deducted or increased upon a victory or a loss. That pretty much means that the majority of players intentionally lose to combat players of less experience, so unless you can break through that first threshold or drop some money, I don't recommend this game.",1,2019-05-18 05:04:54
DO NOT DOWNLOAD IF YOU DON'T INTEND TO SPEND MONEY. Been playing this ever since it came out. I used to love it. But for some time now it has become impossible for f2p players to progress. This game has become a big cash grabbing scam. They keep adding unnecessary things just to provoke players to spend money. This game is outright unfair to f2p players. There's no point fighting in clan wars too unless you have 4 maxed out decks and that will take several years if you don't spend money.,1,2024-08-11 01:39:32

"This game got a lot less fun since they've started phasing out the 2v2 battles. In the past they had multiple modes for 2v2 which would change regularly. Recently they took away almost all of those options and made the button for 2v2 mode super hard to find. 2v2 was most of what I liked about Clash Royale, I really liked it and thought it was an awesome game. I would play it a lot with my partner, and even buy the pass royale. I think taking away 2v2 was a bad idea and will lose many players.",3,2023-09-24 04:06:10
"Now I don't normally write too many reviews, but this game was special to me. Now I'm no FTP player, I did spend money on the pass back when it was actually good value, but when they reworked it I stopped. And with level 15, one of my friends bought the deal that gave you a level 15 and he did that for 3 cards. I feel so far behind now because I don't want to spend more money. Level 15 in the first place was just a horrible idea. (I would talk about how evolutions suck too but I'm out of space)",1,2023-07-19 23:27:12
"supercell does not know how to manage there game, they dont know how to balance there cards, the match making sucks just because you have the same trophies does not mean it should be a match like lvl 13 vs lvl 15 is crazy, the heroes are unbalanced the balancing team should get fired asap.",1,2026-01-31 15:57:39
"Great graphics, easy to play and lots of fun. More coins should be available for long time players without $$$ purchases.

"Awful game. It was great when there weren't so many tryharders. Unplayable, and the matchmaking is always against some players. I can't play no deck, cause i always find an opponent with the counter deck. Never playing it again Edit: the last update made my game unplayable. I always get stuck on the main screen with no possibility to switch to clan chat, card collection or shop. Even chests are stuck. Can't battle... Overall can't play it...",1,2024-06-23 03:48:21

I absolutely love this game. I've been playing for years on an off since the game's launch and can't think of much to change. Except for something to do with connection issues. Just imagine you're winning and have 40 seconds left in overtime and your connection drops out. You reconnect just in time to see your tower being destroyed. I think there should be something that can detect when you have a connection issue and doesn't make you lose trophies. Still recommend getting the game though,4,2022-04-06 12:24:52

"After a couple years I needed to change my review. So glad I never spent a dime. All you will fight are the same 3 decks. Everyone uses the same. Want an easy win?

why why why does it keep showing bad connection all the games I play currently uses wifi but none have outright bad connection that just stops all loading this is ridiculous and its hard to progress too if ur not throwing urself into losing games hoping to win I can admit skill issue but w so few ways to upgrade my cards this just become a way harder game to play then it should be,1,2025-09-21 23:06:04

"You can only lvl your decks to max fast if you buy the gold pass, but that doesn't guarantee champions until you're lvl 14 which means atleast 2+ years of game play, or paying up that credit card. The matchmaking is what called this game quits for me. After years of playing classic challenges, I've learned their algorithm. They'll let you win 7 times in a row but then hit you with the most ridiculous counters for the next few matches.",1,2022-01-17 23:03:15

"I used to play this game, and in the beggining of my experience with this game, I loved it. But then, the matches started to get way to aggressive and competitive, it felt like I was playing a tournament, every single match. It's like they didn't want me to progress, but rather to stay in my same ranking for the rest of my life, 1/5, would choose zero if I could, wouldn't recommend ಠ⁠ಗ⁠ಠ",1,2023-11-24 09:19:27
"My gameplay has gone worse during the update. A slow loading screen occurs when I started a battle. After the loading is finished, I saw a 3 crown defeat. I suggest that while the player is already loaded and the other player is still loading, a waiting screen occurs for the player that's ready and the one that's loading. Or you can add a low and high quality on settings so that the performance is unique. Loading is only my problem, it would be great to resolve this simple problem.

I love the game ever since it came out I was interested but now with the most recent update I have been getting more frustrated because the game struggles to load wich never happened and the game freezes in lobby causing me to not even open chests but the worst thing is that if I get a match in 1v1 or even 2v2 the game freezes and automatically kicks my out of the app. It would be very appreciated if this problem could be resolved. thank you.,1,2019-07-03 22:39:19

"Clash Royale looks fun but has serious problems. The game creates stress and frustration, slowly hurting players mentally. Losing often feels unfair because money matters more than skill. Pay-to-win mechanics give rich players an advantage and make free players feel useless. This causes anger and a toxic community.

"I've been an on and off player since the game released, playing very heavily since until clan wars 2 and all I have to say after the new update is that Supercell should be ashamed of themselves for ostracizing their long standing player base and demanding more money for things that used to be part of the CHEAPER pass. The new system is atrocious and it shows by the amount of players you are losing. Great job killing your own game! 10/10 would NOT recommend",1,2023-04-04 01:04:36
I used to buy the pass royale every month. It was a reasonable price. In this latest update they have hiked the price and give you less rewards. A terrible update no one asked for.

"The update removed the ability to get chests in party mode. It was the only mode where casual players could win chests and not have to stress about dropping trophies if they lost.

Forgot how bad it was until I played it again. In the lead? You opponent seems to comeback almost every single time like they recharge elixir faster than you. Want to get higher ranks? We'll give you opponents who've maxed out everything. Follow advice for making a good deck? You're opponent seems to always counter everything you try to do.

Loot crates were okay as a secondary item, even as annoying as they are to open, but completely having them take over limits uniqueness in the game.",1,2025-04-07 03:11:31
its a good game so far and the battles seem hard but also kinda easy and strategic wise,5,2025-12-08 05:40:36
After 6 years I am done with this game... U may ask y? Because Devs only know how to ask for money but they have no clue how to keep the connection stable.,1,2025-12-20 23:06:36
"it's really fun. and I've played it for probably 50+ hours and there is only 1 issue for me the matches don't give you random opponents. well sort of the higher you get the more noticeable it is. matches are tailored to your deck you can get matching decks, decks you counter or decks that counter you 60% of the time it's the 3rd one I played 4 matches in a row and it was the same deck with or 2 different cards that were mostly just cycle cards.",4,2025-10-26 05:59:09
"The game is fun and unique, I've played this game for around 3-4 years. There's one thing that is bad about this game, it is the matchmaking system. I'm level 11 and all my troops are at the same level, but when I go to the higher ranks the game tends to pair me with maxed out level 13 players with level 13 cards which is truly unfair. I've loved the game, but not it's frustrating and boring. I hope in the future the matchmaking system will pair you with your level or somehow your match.",1,2020-08-16 06:53:50
"I have been playing for a while and like the game, but it is SO pay to win that it gets boring, this is coming from someone who has never spent a dime on the game. So many people in challenger have spent money, it is ridiculous, it causes me to no longer be able to advance on. I am level 10 and have gotten whooped by a level 9 with level 11 and 12 cards, this game is sometimes very infuriating. If you spend, you can do anything in no time, if you do not, good luck, for you will suffer.",4,2019-05-31 07:33:28
probably the most frustrating game available since matchmaking is rigged to favour enemy nearly 100% of the time. you literally have to hope they are either trash or they leave since you are pit against cards that just completely counter yours no good balance changes - most annoying no skill cards are left at peak whereas trash cards aren't reworked or updated. game is a haven for p2w since there is so many opportunities player base is toxic and clowns on you after running no skill decks,1,2025-10-13 02:56:19
Since many years I've been playing this game but i don't think I'll waste my time any more on it... The major reason is the big delay when i want to drop the cards... It takes about 2 seconds while the opponent is attacking my tower... First i thought its from the net... After i discovered that you make these changes... I'm waiting a reply on that,3,2022-12-08 21:00:53
"The UI stutter is getting me, and animations after battle. Also when tabbing around in main menu. kinda making me want to quit.

Please fix the matchmaking or atleast give some more type of games without involving trophies ! I keep losing again higher level players and I can't chill out when I lose . It is impossible for a casual player to chill out in this game . Only maxed out players can play and only for those people it will be fun.",3,2021-01-08 10:00:58

But with these wild changes and constant mistakes they have been making over these years, especially as of lately, I can no longer say the same. With a game that puts itself as pay to win as much as it can, I would not even consider adding a single penny to it. +1 star for the fun it used to give me.",2,2025-05-11 06:52:51

"This game is addicting but don't think there are enough new people playing the game for proper game balance. I strongly recommend you don't go above 6k cups until you've played the game for a couple of years or more. All the early adopters of the game reside there, and getting what you may feel is a fair match-up is occasional at best. The ladder helps with troop weight as all match play is at lvl 11, but matching is brutal even at 5k cups. Also, If you don't buy gems, you likely won't stay.",3,2023-09-07 03:31:00

Greed ruined the company i have lost a old account with hundreds of hours on it duo to them changing the login they say we cannot find the account even when i provided almost all the info so they have either deleted old inactive acccounts or are just too lazy to check properly the game itself is a pay to win dont waste time find another game,1,2025-08-28 21:01:22
Horrible pay-to-win game every match or every other match is gonna be an enemy with at least a champion or level 13 cards. It's unfair to people like me who do free-to-play having to grind and get my cards.

"I've been playing this since it came out. My account is maxed out, even then, the amount of ""pay to win"" is ridiculous. It's frustrating how much they've been destroying the game over making the ""pay to win"" stuff over-powered. It's so bad now that it feels like every single game you play is the same decks over and over. Whatever card is meta, that's all you will ever play for seasons straight. It's gotten SO BAD. I don't recommend you play this unless you plan on spending $50 weekly on it.",1,2024-12-17 00:04:08
"It's one of those games where you have to spend money to be at the top. Also, I've noticed lately that it pairs me with people or computer players that will be able to counter my deck.

"Was an extremely fun game and the essential fundamentals of the game are still there. However, in the pursuit of further monetization they have killed the game. Releasing a brand new card that is absolutely broken which can only be bought with money (every new evolution). By the time you can get the card for free it has already been nerfed. This cycle is repeated every update and season. Unless you are planning to spend at least $30 every month on a mobile game that is dying do not install.",1,2024-06-26 01:48:59

I started back when the first game came out because I was big into clash of clans. took a break for a few years then came back about 6 months ago and was really enjoying it. having taken some time off I was severely under leveled which makes sense. while I have a long way to go this new update might be the nail in the coffin.

"Game was really fun at the start, but as you progress further you're kind of forced to spend money if you want to compete.

I never purchased any in app extras. until recently. the amount of time it takes to level up is insane compared to how fast you level up when you buy stuff, especially the battle pass. it's kinda lame that it's soo pay to win based. some of the cards are broken (electric giant) and makes the game un enjoyable at times. but, I still play a few matches here and there.",3,2024-06-25 01:05:37
"This is a new review, 1 star lower (was 3 before) because my previous review was removed. Thats a shady move. First off, the game has solid gameplay, and seldomly has bugs... I can not say much negative there. However, the matchmaking system is 100% based on trophy level alone, which makes for mismatched matches far more often than well matched one. Furthermore, the emote system has produced a player base with the worst sportsmanship and toxic behavior I have ever seen in gaming.",2,2022-01-31 00:04:20

"The game was fun at first, but after reaching a few arenas, I noticed something way off. I kept losing in every match and I thought it was because I had to redo my deck. After reworking my deck I STILL kept losing. This was because in almost every match, you're fighting someone who is a much higher level than you. It's rediculously unbalanced. Some cards are also overpowered and you don't have cards to counter said OP card. Overall, the game in unbalanced. This is basically a pay to win game.",1,2019-09-24 18:34:47
"Great game, well balanced cards with updates every 2 weeks. Unfortunately it is getting to the point where it is impossible for F2P players to progress and the meta in itself is unsustainable due to too many different cards.. more variety is great but 90 odd cards in a game that worked fine with 40 is a bit much.

I used to spend a decent amount on this game and they got me a lil with evolution, but now I'll probly never spend another penny",1,2023-07-04 06:43:24
"This game is only fun when you buy all the ""special"" offers, so you can get over leveled troops as well as evolutions for your troops. The only way you will beat a P2W player is if they are actually stupid. The only way past this is to make evolutions easier to get or give them to people for free. I'm not the most strategic person ever, but the number of times I have lost because they have limited time troops that are op in lower areanas or because they spent money on levels is unfathomable.",1,2024-06-13 01:08:14
I've had the Clash for 3 years and its been really fun to play with mates and everything the reason I gave it 4 stars though is because of me not being able to find the right clan and emote spammers in-game.

"Game is fun for both strategists and spammers, also p2w players can have much more fun as likely with every game to be fair.

That has never happened before and I hope doesn't happen often.",5,2025-10-23 21:14:54
pay to win trash from a desperate company these people are out of touch with the community and have no idea how to actually add updates without adding a paywall.

"Gameplay became boring. Update is confusing with so many gamemodes and unobtainable tiers without paying money. Updates just comes with more unoriginal gameplay (capture, spawner etc).Even recent updates just makes this game even more boring by slowing progression down (They are going to add level 15). I know you're never going to listen to the reviews, but if this is the way this game is heading, then it's lost.",1,2023-07-07 15:50:01

this game sucks it is too pay to win but at the same time addicting as hell I wish I could give it 0 stars.,1,2026-01-25 02:58:14

worse dev team for a game I've ever seen they be doing literally the exact opposite of what the community wants each time and the game is pay to win AF also jynxi revived the game not the trash devs but they really tried to use jynxi revive to make a massive cash grab with level 16 and heroes which made there profits go down by millions not up massively deserved they game deserves to die at this point won't play this garbage again,1,2026-01-27 06:47:46

It's quite obvious this game is p2w, and I tried to play without spending money, but I had to succumb. I tried to buy the Arena 11 special offer, but it wouldn't even let me. It just said something went wrong and greyed out until the offer ran out. Also, with the recent level 15 and evolutions update, this game is going downhill fast.",1,2023-06-28 12:26:18

"It's not bad. A Lot Of Grinding is needed. Lots of gold. I don't play often except when they have special mode such as infinite elixir, gold rush. In clan war, I enjoy the race mode, double elixir and ramp up etc. Don't like the sudden death or rage battle much. But other modes r pretty fun. I like variety of party mode.

It used to be a great game but their is no strategy now. It used to be 30 or 50 cards so that you always had a counter to attacks which meant the game play was based upon strategy. Now with over 100 cards theirs no strategy it just depends on who has the stronger deck. Sad to see an excellent game go so far downhill. Would give it zero if I could.,1,2024-12-23 22:23:02
Rigged matchmaking and pay to win. Could be a good game if devs weren't greedy and actually cared,1,2026-01-19 05:32:31
This game is horrible they refuse to nerf insanely overpowered card such as the mega Knight and pekka and the game is unplayable also they removed chests and the event shop this game is getting worse and worse,5,2026-01-30 00:41:14
"they use AI for hard counters of your deck in trophy road so you can spend more time in game, release new Evo cards that are broken and then nerf them in 2 weeks and in merge tactics you will experience ping lag and sometimes the game will crash and you won't get any trophies. Not worthy of your time in 2025, they just want to make more money so they can touch and nerf minor",1,2025-10-04 02:12:31

I appreciate that changes were made, but these changes are not welcomed, especially the large increase in price.

"It's a fine game in theory, but the entire leveling system makes it a pay to win nightmare. You can run into a game with a person 2 levels ahead of you, and your opponent's deck is effectively 40% better than yours. No serious strategy game can exist with such a system. On top of this, the new card evolution system is just another way to make the game even more pay to win. To my knowledge, as a free-to-play player, it takes AT LEAST 6 months to evolve 1 card. There are 109 cards in this game.",1,2023-09-10 08:08:18

Will only allow you to get so far then you're pitted against people 2 levels above so you just cannot win. Once your trophy count is down again, you start winning again. Uninstalled and will not make the mistake of returning again. Only way to progress at a reasonable rate is to buy the cards you want.",1,2019-01-29 20:29:45
"It's a really well made game, and while there are overpowered cards, it does not invoke spam due to the variety of cards and decks. And frankly if you think it's a skill issue or spam, it's probably a skill issue. Although, the amount of p2w is INSANELY high, like you can be at the start of the game and people can already have evolutions, a very op type of card. And for people like me who love the game, but don't have money to spend on it, we are kinda screwed to hoping we don't have to face p2w",2,2023-11-19 21:02:11
"Fun head to head gameplay!! *Update* Used to be fun and thoughtfully balanced, but it is becoming fully pay to win. Every new card is released very overpowered, and you can pay a bunch of money (think $30-$50) to instantly level it up to max level. I'm just so disheartened that they continue to actively choose to take this direction with their game. I've been playing for years, but I can't continue to support this game at this point.",1,2024-04-13 13:59:44

"Played for a long time (since it came out), put in some money (probably close to $200 over time), but its sooooo pay to win its BS. You can only get so far without needing to pay HUNDREDS of dollars (I'm not exaggerating). They dont balance cards right and some cards are overpowered (like inferno tower) while others are borderline useless (like elixir pump).

Actually fun, but they just chose to ruin it all. Firstly if you have single target units, and someone has skeleton army, you lose. Like the matchups are not balanced. All you get is a person who beats you up so badly you do not even attack them, that means they are obviously a bot.",1,2021-03-27 21:59:42

People with no skill or iq are all over being toxic af the developers are retarded and dont know what needs buff and nerds so they listen to the brain dead toxic players. dont play unless you plan on spending at least $200 to get a some what chance to win. being extremely honest this game is TRASH,1,2026-01-29 10:06:19

It suffers from some heinous pay to win practices, dont believe the lies they say, the legendary cards carry games and there's nothing you can do if you get behind even a bit. It's great starting out when there aren't too many cards to unlock but once you get higher up if you don't stay on top of unlocking cards you will have a horrible time grinding loss after loss just to try to get the daily crown chest.

love this game but people are using mods so they have better cards you should have a system that auto bans people that use mods or have cards that they modified to a larger level.

I mean, one can keep quiet about the evo cards thing in first, but like now? it is literally impossible to play. very bad update, and very bad game in general im just playing for the old memories.",1,2025-04-04 22:10:42
"used to be great but it's so pay-to-win nowadays that it's basically unplayable if you don't want to spend all your money getting your troops to max level. The matchmaking could be a lot better, me and nearly everyone I know struggle if they're in mid ladder, nearly entirely to do with our enemies entire decks being 2 levels higher, so matchups dont work and elixir trades are always detrimental. if they fix this then it would defo be much higher",3,2025-10-19 06:11:53

"the game will but ylu purposely into games that hard counter your deck, and will only let you win once or twice to keep you playing. the whole game is pay to win and in games we're you have every card, the game will purposely put you into games we're the other player has a counter to your deck as a whole",1,2025-10-05 00:36:02

"Boring, pay to win. Predictable mis matching in a not so clever attempt to line people's pockets. Only way to progress is to empty your account and buy your way through. Or just play for the next 8/9 years and you'll be half way up the ranking. Too many players with zero skill just using inferno towers etc, because they aren't very good at the game. Would of been a good game if not for greed and bots",1,2023-03-25 21:56:22
"It's fun until you reach a certain level, but then, it starts to get really annoying when you start to confront low level players with maxed out cards that they get through buying everything they can, making it a mismatch because sometimes there is no way to beat them, after a year of playing this, I'm getting bored just because of that",3,2019-09-30 23:24:13
"If you're a new or returning player I'd advise not playing as the recent decisions have clearly shown that the developers are very out of touch of what the players want. This update takes more away from the players than given. To throw 2v2 in the party tab which doesn't give chests but now no crowns either to progress the battle pass that's now very unrewarding compared to it's previous version, which costs more with it's new tier that costs twice as much! I'd rather no update than this.",1,2023-04-04 13:58:00
it is a good game but it is just to many people are pay yo win and yall do not have any new cards in the game or any new evos its getting to the point where im going to quit so just add new evos please thank you,4,2026-01-18 23:28:07
"It's a some-what entertaining game to pass short periods of time but it takes way too long to open chests, which you're limited to four in total. They take 3hours or more to unlock and they can only be opened one at a time. So basically after 4wins in a 3 hour period you don't get much of anything for further victories. Also, I have a Samsung Galaxy J3 Emerge and have played this game on my last 3 phones but I can't link to my Google at account in game so I'm starting over again",4,2022-06-14 07:18:23
"This game was very good from the start, fun and strategic, however, the credit card has the final say. You may play and face players with higher level cards due to the terrible matchmaking or just that the other player spent more money. The lastest updates have only hurt those who don't spend money, making progression longer and slower with no fun features, just copy and pasted events. The developers have great ideas but only care about those who spend money, reminds me of War Thunder.",1,2023-06-20 01:48:41
"I have been playing it since 6 years but now when I installed it after a break, 2-3 months ago there were some issues I faced. I thought might be network issue but after I started playing daily it became worse and I uninstalled. Again I downloaded it since a month, the problem persists and its not network issue. 1 year back it took 1-2 seconds for card deployment but now it takes 4 seconds for a card to deploy.

"Like any other pay to win game it's fun at first then you get to level 7-8 and you are stuck if you play without buying gems. You could 'out-strategize' your opponent and his purchased armies will still roll right over you. Sounds fun right? Also, the servers drop signal periodically. Also, they have formulas for pairing decks up against opponents i.e. if you have a Giant, you opponents will have some anti-giant card to make them competitive.",2,2019-09-20 00:58:12
Takes too long to open chests with only 4 slots available then fights have no benefits at all while you wait 8 hours for one chest to open and the others say there doing nowt.

One of the worst cash grab games on the market after recent update. Slowed progression down to an all time low nerfed the gold pass and double the price for it. Actual game play has gone down so much with evolutions and to make it worse is the match making makes it so you win one and lose 3 in ranked to make you pay for additional cards to try and win more games but that won't work. Game has gone down hill so much and it's a shame.,1,2025-04-28 02:36:41

"Higher levels are unbalanced and it becomes a waste of time. I'm at the lowest crowns in my tier and EVERY single game matches me against players with higher level cards. The game is more fun at low levels where cards are more balanced and not much stronger, even if a level or two is uneven.

They try to show you that it is not possible to win and also will show you that you can buy everything. I hate to play this game after 5000 trophies as it is not fair, to spend time.

"The game hasn't changed in the slightest for over a year now. It's the same meta constantly being used. If you aren't max level cards you don't push far and lose constantly, only people who play are top tier ranking. If you are new or under th-13, just delete the game and find something else to play. Update: They added pay to win cards. If you go against those people that have the pay to win cards you lose.

"After playing on and off over the years, I finally felt some sort of accomplishment after upgrading most the cards I frequently use to the max level and nothing will beat how I felt when I reached Legendary Arena for the first time. Sadly, it seems the devs keep shifting the goal post farther and farther, requiring more time and money to reach that feeling of accomplishment. Its a vicious cycle that im finally comfortable breaking. Was fun while it lasted, but this update truly is for losers.",1,2023-04-07 10:41:41
"Alright, I'm going to be brutally honest with you. At first, I thought this game was legit garbage. That was until I unlocked hog rider. After that, it became my number one phone app. I started clearing my schedule to give me at least five hours a day to play. I find that hog rider brings me comfort. I open the game and hear that beautiful jingle, I see the loading screen and then.... an angelic delight.

"It would be higher. I am a champion player, played for just over a year. The game itself is really good, its a challange especially if you're underlevelled. The reason it's not higher is, over the year of playing it I noticed that instead of finding true balance in the cards they have now, they repeatedly bring out new cards quicker than they can balance the game. Every time you update, you break the game either in terms of having to sort out bugs that slow and lag the game out or an op card",4,2019-07-01 20:50:54

Earlier, it was fun",1,2023-04-17 14:14:37
"The game was very different and cool at first. Unfortunately the game has to turned into a ""pay to play"" so to speak. Yes, the game is free but if you are unwilling to pay for additional help throughout the game you will find yourself getting beat over and over by either unfair matchups in levels or people who are willing to shell out hard earned cash just to be able to compete with others.

I'll keep it short, the once simple interface has become crowded horribly, this fun game has become increasingly pay to win and is getting more complex and confusing just to earn a few more bucks.

If there was an option of giving 0 stars out of 5, I would have chosen that; this game doesn't deserve your time. As frustrating as anything.",1,2018-11-18 14:06:05
It is a ton of fun and has a little bit of a learning curve but nothing a few YouTube videos won't fix.

Fun To play. A lot of people say it's unfair and you have to buy stuff. But I had to start all over with nothing because I forgot my password on an old account and I climbed back to tower lvl. 11 and the level with the two gold swords crossing in like 2 or 3 months. I just recently started getting the pass to speed up the process cause you get extra rewards. So I don't believe you have to buy stuff or that it's unfair.

When it comes to games it feels like the skill aspect of it is slowly disappearing. Broken cards and card evolutions are released monthly and locked behind a pay wall.

Merge Tactics has a flaw. The wizard team up is not accurate. I just had a game where they kept making a 2-star a rabbit when there were 4 3 star units on the field. This makes me feel that the rankings are already pre-determined and no actual strategy truly helps. I thought merge Tactics would be a good break from trophy road but that just irritated me too far.

Otherwise a nice bit of casual PvP.",4,2019-02-03 09:59:24

I'm just some guy.",4,2021-04-10 14:59:18
"As a concept this game is cool, but at the end of the day this game is not about how skilled or strategic you are, it's really about what level your cards(troops) are at. When you first get the game it's fine, you'll level stuff up decently quick. But eventually you hit a wall around lvl 10-11 where you either have to spend money on the game, or play it obsessively for years in order to progress.

I hate coming back to this game because my king tower is somehow level 13 but most of my cards are level 11, so I can't make any decks work because of the level of cards I'm up against. it's also incredibly difficult to get enough cards in order to level them up, and it's now impossible for me to get evolutions without paying an absurd amount of money.",1,2025-06-06 14:38:23
Horrible. When I try to go into special challenges it takes between 7min to 15 minutes for a match and then I am put up against a player that has hundreds of hours more experience and a team that is ridiculously better than mine.

This is more of a personal issue, but I think Balloons should either do less damage, or be 6 elixir.

Stop being greedy Suprcell Trade tokens. Cool. The moment you sell them in the play shop now both people need a token... And why in the hell would I want to pay gold to donate a card to anyone? Cause that wastes gold and you hope I'll buy more. Adding this to my below comment and this is well on its way to being a game I don't play anymore. Don't get comfortable with the cards you spend months building up to a good level. They Nerf good cards far too much. A better game would play test more and not need to break cards that have been in use for a long time. Balloon death damage timer and Fireball building damage being good examples. Balloon generally won't hurt whatever shot it down anymore. Fireball I worked mine up to max level and had 300 building damage now it's been nerfed to 265.

"i loe the emotes really fun and kids friendly!!!! especially the pig one,",5,2026-02-02 21:33:37
"Used to be good. The game at its core is good, the company ruined it, thanks Supercell. Almost all of the rewards you get to progress through playing are locked behind a pay wall, it is extremely difficult to progress without spending money, and that I cannot forgive. 1 star, unfortunate. Also bring back party modes like triple draft against random opponents, that was the best part of the game.",1,2023-08-16 11:04:43
"I would like to make a suggestion. When one of the players during a match goes without internet, trophies should not be lost for this player. Maybe you can give the trophies to the oppountnet winner, but the one without internet should no lost trophies.",5,2025-10-18 01:23:15
"I remember when this game was enjoyable. Microtransactions litter every single screen, and now they've even tried disguising some of them with ""tap for more info"" instead of just telling you prices. This is honestly stupid. Having a few here and there (like for gold or gems) is acceptable, considering the core game is free, and is... somewhat playable without buying a bunch of stuff, but this is just ridiculous. Supercell isn't the fun company they used to be. Don't waste your time or your cash.",2,2024-07-21 02:25:25
"No skill. No strategy. This was my favorite game for years. Now I can tell you in the first 5 seconds who will win. Sometimes before my cards even appear they have already played a card. Other times you can see the same cards in both decks and either their cards or yours will move significantly slower and get distroyed much faster with the same defense. I can win 6 games in a row one day and loss 10 in a row the next day. It has nothing to do with your skills. Im just about done with this ""game""",1,2019-02-28 10:05:04
"After they made the decision to switch from $5 pass to a two tier pass $5/$12 I continued to play because I enjoyed the game. After the most recent update, the game never loads on the first try and consistently crashes during battles. I went from loving this game to uninstalling it in about 2 months time. Supercell seems to be doing everything they can to ruin a once enjoyable experience. I wouldn't waste my time with this game ad I definitely wouldn't waste my money.",1,2023-06-27 01:08:06
"Used to play this game alot, for about 6 years and really enjoyed the game. But the game has been on a slow but sure decline since clan wars 2, then they add evos and champs which makes things annoying and too complicated, rather than listening to the community, supercell would rather just add things that'll make more money, I understand it's a business but they're losing way to many players for the money to be worth it.",1,2024-04-04 07:36:29
"Horrible, truly one of the worst games that you wanna have fun with. Terrible matchmaking, being paired up with opponents that have cards that are higher level than yours. The progression is slow unless you're going pay actual money for it. Even though this game is more unique than the mobile games we have today this is still one of the most cash grab and worst matchmaking system games ever. How is it even gonna be considered a strategy game if the level gaps are huge.",1,2025-03-09 19:16:48
"I have been playing this for years. And I still play almost every single day. This game has always been a 5 star game for me. My problem now is they have been ramping up on all the ""pay to accelerate"" options. Which I don't love and wish they didn't have, but fine people can buy what they want. But now they are deliberately slowing down your free to play progress. Idk just thought someone might want an honest review",3,2024-04-27 13:33:58
This game is fun but 🫤 the bad part is that I keep getting player higher or stronger opponents then me even tho I have weak cards the enemies have hight level cards then me thats the bad part it would be more fair if I could go against people who have the same levels as me,3,2025-10-26 03:19:38
"It's a very fun strategy game but it has a major problem for me at least, it is pay to win. I've been playing it for 3 years I have never spent a penny on it and I see the difference between me and my opponents / clan m8's that do actually spend money on the game. Besides that the developers are active, they always update it to keep the game fresh and I respect that.",4,2019-12-14 21:28:38
This game has become a scam. Nobody asked for Level 15 and 50 000 Elite Wild Cards to upgrade one card is insane. It would take a free-to-play player literal years to upgrade their collection. I was at 8000+ trophies and the meta has become riddled with Evolutions which are hard to counter and hard to come by for free-to-play players aside from specific events. I have hundreds of Wild Cards that I literally cannot use because there are not enough ways to get gold to upgrade my cards! AVOID THIS!,1,2024-11-03 11:36:03
This game is terrible. There are so many over-leveled people and Supercell is the most greedy company ever.,1,2025-11-25 09:58:23
"has INSANE potential, and is completely RUINED by the insane pay to win system. I know this review wont change anything about the game, but i can say this to people wondering if they should play, the answer is yes. Just know its going to be infuriating, happy clashing.",3,2025-10-19 13:51:40
There should be the option to lock cards for a deck so when you want to generate a deck it'll generate a good synergized deck with the locked card(s) instead of randomly generated decks with what you have collected.,3,2025-10-07 16:31:51
The game can be frustrating at times but it can also be really fun. I like how there are special game modes where you van get cards easier to lvl the cards you want up. Clash of clans is mainly about strategy or over lvled cards. You should definitely pick up this game because it is a good game to play in the car at home or in your free time. But if you get mad or rage just decide to put the game down and pick it up latter. I hope you think my review was worth reading and pick up clash of clans.,4,2023-12-13 20:24:32
"By far the worst pay to win game I had ever played. You have absolutely no chance against someone who has spent money, on it. Its virtually impossible for a casual player to enjoy. SuperCell got carried away with earning money, thus making the matchmaking the worst part of it. You can't do anything against a level 10, or higher when your just an average player. Download this if you want to pull your hair out.",1,2020-10-31 06:00:36
"Im really fed up of the way supercell are making the game pay to win again. It was at a point where as pay to skip it was acceptable, but as I got to the upper leagues and they add another level? The people that can afford to spend stupid amounts on this will beat me with higher level cards, though they wouldn't beat me with same level. You should only ever pay for aesthetics in games like this. Feel ripped off. I have played as long as CR has been around and spent more than I could afford.",4,2021-11-02 03:39:15
"Sad to see how far this game has fallen. Unless you plan to pay for every release, good luck attempting to get anywhere. The rank system just allows you to get close to your next goal and then repeatedly hits you with players who are light years ahead of you or who pay for everything. Don't worry though they will just release another game in order to attempt to get more of your money vs just making a game that is fun and fair for its players.",1,2024-05-13 01:42:07
it's super good and fun and Larry is my favorite I hope for more and even better updates and more troops:),5,2026-01-23 03:03:59
"Flawless so far. Exceptional Gameplay. Exciting PvP. Minimal Errors. No bugs (at least for me) Simple. But can you kindly fix the matching algorithm. I often get matched with players, 2 levels higher than me. This might seem low, but if you play, you know how this feels. Kindly make the matching a little more fair for us lowlies... Tnx",4,2022-10-07 21:45:12
"this game is the accurate meaning of ""pay to win"" it used to be something greater but now they have fallen for their greed، never forget that the game can control your trophies with counter decks matchups designed to keep you stuck longer.",1,2025-11-16 10:55:59
"Recent updates have made the game unplayable. It's completely rigged. I have never seen a game penalize you the more you play. Used to be fun now waste of time. Money pit. Boring. Stupid game that never adjusts the most overpowered card in the game the ""hog rider"". Played this game for two years but im done with this junk. No variety. So much strategy involved in this game... Every opponent drops the hog rider at the bridge and thats the game. Should be called ""Hog Royale"". Don't waste your time.",1,2018-12-30 00:40:34
"Used to play the game until my old phone became too slow to play it on. Now, I have a new Moto E 5 play and although it doesn't lag, in 75% of matches it crashes. Means the only thing I can consistantly play is 2 v 2. I doubt you care about a problem on a less popular phone that isn't an iPhone but I would appreciate it a lot if you could fix this bug. Thanks for reading",2,2018-12-09 22:02:10
"As a player since launch it saddens me to say this game is not worth the time anymore. Supercell used to take player feedback, now player feedback means nothing. We get changes we know is bad for this game only justified by the chance somebody might like it, the average player doesn't matter. The game used to be free to play, as of it's current state it's free to lose. Leveling is a major part of the game, and takes time, but if you open your wallet it's instantaneous, the higher level wins.",1,2023-06-21 05:37:05
one of the best game I ever played i am addicted to this now this is so simple but so fun sometimes the games feels unfair but this game is so great if u are curious about playing it just give it s try u will love it,5,2025-12-18 20:48:45
I don't rate or review games much. But this is one of those games that started out great and has turned into a disappointment. The game is extremely unbalanced I give them props for trying but it's just horrible this is the third time I'm deleting this game and it's going to be permanent this time. I like some of their efforts like releasing new troops on a regular basis but until the mechanics of the game is fixed I can't play it.,1,2023-12-30 09:30:12
1.3.2023 Update: Freeze is exactly what happens. This game is TERRIBLE. Not only does it happens to me all the time but I notice when some isn't playing back 👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿 (Update available and I'll see if anything changes) Game has been cutting off in the middle of a game. I'm steady losing points and battles but constantly upgrading. Fix the bug or cancel the battle if a player disconnect. Update: it's getting worst and I'm ready to uninstall I do not buy pass anymore cuz I'm unhappy af,1,2023-01-03 22:48:27
At this point is just a pay to win game. I'm level 12 with cards at level 12 or below and at 7500 trophies I end up with level 14 with cards 14 or above and Evo cards. Unfortunately if you don't pay you can't upgrade your cards or get Evo cards which is unfortunate cause the game itself is so good.,2,2025-09-25 01:30:40
"Customer service needs some help. Asking for well over 24 hours why I havent received a purchase I made, and I get ""send me the invoice."" I do. Hours later someone else chimes in, and says ""give it x time."" I do. Message again and they say they are there. Nope, still not. Still waiting for a response, but itll probably be 3 or 4 hours before anyone gets back to me, again. Playing for 3 years, and this is the first time I've had to deal with the obviously bad customer service, hopefully the last.",1,2019-05-24 02:44:25
Game is ruined by terrible matchmaking. There's no fun in playing versus someone that has cards all 3 levels higher than mine. I pay for the season pass but I will not pay a significant amount of money to max out my deck just so I can play a fair matchup. Supercell is greedy. The could and should be a great game. If this does not improve I will be happy to find other games to play and delete this.,1,2020-09-19 04:42:21
Came back after a few years to play the game. I'd say I ran through at least 100 games against other player that were supposed to be at my level but lost about 85 of those 100 game simply because those other players had cards both not accessible to me and a much higher level than mine even though they were at my level. This game has completely lost its sense of balance.,1,2022-01-02 13:17:03
"The game used to be fun back in 2019 for me but now it's the next level of pay2win. It's so greedy of supercell to have this much micro transactions in their game, i still can't believe a while ago there were 16 available bundles to get and each give you an advantage over your enemies. I just hope it gets fixed. Anyways i gave it three stars because the game itself deserves 5 stars.",3,2024-03-29 22:56:17
Monotonous and not dynamic game. After a while you can't improve if you don't follow some patterns in terms of possible card combinations. Somehow it forces you to use combinations of cards that take away your freedom of choice. Some cards are very unbalanced. The main purpose of the game is to make the users pay for the prizes. Money rules the game. It also fails a lot due to internal errors. The new war update made everything even worse.,2,2020-09-07 14:30:26
"Impossible to advance when Im being put up against players who have way better cards than me. The matchmaking could be far better with a couple tweaks, but I guess the devs are too busy jerking off to change simple C++ code. And then when I get one singular lag spike for one microsecond, the entire game crashes and it prevents you from placing anything. An autistic infant born with anencephaly and a 47th chromosome per cell could code better than this. 0/10, too addicting and underhated.",1,2025-10-02 13:53:36
I'm lvl 35 king tower 12 at 8k trophies and I'm only matching with lvl 13-14-15 and I'm not getting the chance to progress so what's the point when they only way to enjoy the game anymore is to have to spend ridiculous amounts of money,1,2025-09-23 10:42:58
I used to play since year 1 and loved the game but abandoned it about a year ago. Returned to play because I heard there was new stuff but it is the same thing over and over. You added one more level to cards and made the gold requirements still ridiculously high just to force people to either grind eternally or put up some cash... The battles are exciting and the game modes are entertaining but it is still not enough to keep me back.,3,2022-01-14 10:44:31
"The game doesn't get updated very frequently anymore, and many of the updates don't add or change much about the game play. In spite of this, the game still can be fun. I especially enjoy the clan wars battles that help encourage players to try different play styles. I do wish practice day battles weren't limited to one battle with each deck. Only getting to play one battle a day with each deck isn't really practice. 3 practice battles per deck would be better.",4,2021-09-02 23:08:41
The game lagged too hard. I bought more than 100$ worth of gems and they were never charged in my account. When I downloaded the game I had realized it took over 5GB of storage please fix this NOW.,1,2025-10-08 00:56:07
"This game is the epitome of pay to win. It makes EA look good. Everyone above Master 1 uses the same OP decks from 3 years ago. You cannot be creative with your deck. Also, the matchmaking is abysmal. You could be level 10 and go against someone with maxed out cards, which they bought with their mom's credit card. The fact this game is still allowed on the play store is appalling. If I could give negative stars, I would. Save yourself the time and money, do not download if you have a life. :-)",1,2021-06-09 02:04:59
"I love the game and although i have been playing for less than a year, i think I've climbed ladder pretty well. Sure sometimes I'll be put against the most brainless P2W players but overall, it's a great game.",4,2025-09-05 11:20:07
"It is good but still needs a lot of improvements, i have been playing this completely different game mode(spirit something mode), I just opened it to play , all of a sudden it's vanished ?? like it never existed .",2,2025-09-29 17:00:46
they don't support you when it comes to the issues of the game. they just ignore you and give some BS excuses to why they can't help you. One of the biggest scam games out there. not fun at all...... If you want to lose a lot play this game.,1,2025-09-23 07:32:24
this is is not good for u bcs it is pay to win and literally everyone is paying. this game is all AI u r not even playing with real human and all it does is making u lose like ten in a row and make u pay to win it and It basically control the outcome of the round. For example if the game wants u to lose It will give the AI like more exifer and just keep spamming u with the best cards ever.,1,2025-10-07 13:36:08
"Changed fron 5 to 1 stars. Facing huge mismaching, not at the trophees level, but at the cards level. Since a while now, i am quite always facing level 13 decks which i cannot defeat no matter the tactics used. Once my favorite game, it has been put on the to-remove-list. Oh, and the way they managed the tie is BS. Should have been left as it was before.. a tie ! What a shame, after years of playing. Happily uninstalling the game",1,2020-01-13 18:19:14
New update brings the worst playing experience to player who don't pay money in this game.,1,2025-11-26 16:32:08
"So many reasons why this game deserves a low rating. It had the perfect fundamentals, allowing people to play 2v2 with friends and progress through the game. Now your capped at 2 wins for almost no rewards, are their serious? Not only that but have decided to devalue the battle pass by up to 10-15x. What are the developers doing? LISTEN TO YOUR PLAYER BASE SUPERCELL! This game use to be and easy 5 star, amazing gameplay, good mutiplayer experiences. All for supercell to get greedy pockets... fix",2,2023-04-03 18:02:11
THIS GAME IS SOO BAD AT FIRST its good you know peaceful but soon as your reach arena 11 THE GAME BECOME ANNOYING EVERY SINGLE GAME MEGAKNIGHT YOU CANT EVEN WIN ONCE THE GAME BECAME BORING AT THIS POINT and the fact that you lose trophies you can't even go to the next arena but ngl its still pretty fun atleast you can enjoy the next 10 arenas before you start raging and also its not because skill issue its because THEY HAVE AN OVERLEVED DECK and the spam they do just make me want uninstall it,4,2025-11-20 13:03:45
"it would be SO GOODAMAZING even if you just added more ways to get cards, once you reach a high enough arena it isn't even about skill anymore, it's either you have evos or overleveled cards. genuinely how do you even get evos? i have like 2 shards im at 5k trophies and almost all of them have evos, if not they'll have lvl 14 cards. evos are such a big part of the game now and getting them without money seems impossible. Fun but heavily pay to win until your highen for evry1 has the sm levels",3,2025-10-22 11:30:56
"Game creates bot account that's has ever counter to your deck when you hit a certain point on each stage. The closer you get to passing each stage, it appears AI accounts prevents you for moving forward. When reach the top each time you will get 3 consecutive loses pushing down your advancement. The deck will counter what ever deck you're using. Perfect timing, eventhough deck order is supposed to be random.",1,2021-09-03 11:26:55
"The gameplay is fun when its balanced, but you often end up against players much higher or much lower then you. A lot of cash grabs going on and as the game evolves the amount keeps growing. I used to like this game because it was one that you didn't have to spend money to have a chance. This game is not that way anymore.",2,2018-12-09 06:33:28
"I used to love playing this, took a 5 year break and now its a pay to win where every tool with $10 to waste is going to win. uninstalling and not looking back again. the fun has been bought out of this game.",2,2025-09-19 22:46:23
I've been playing this game for about 3 years now . it's been a a very good experience until recently when I've noticed that Clash Royale takes a whole lot more data than usual . Another problem that I've been experiencing with the game is that everytime I log in to play Clash Royale produces a lot of junk that I encounter when cleaning my phones junk. I hope that these issues will be resolved .,3,2019-04-14 23:59:04
"This game was fun at one point. After several nerfs and patches... not so much anymore. The game also feels horribly rigged. You might win one or two but then you'll lose several in a row. It makes it impossible to progress when you've been gaining 50-60 trophies here and there and then losing 90-150 after a few wins. They need to fix this game instead of making it an even bigger cash grab. Edit- with pay to win lvl 15 cards, it's impossible to play anymore. Game sucks.",1,2023-08-11 01:06:46
"What nonsense..!!!😤😤😤 Really disappointed with this game.. I used to love it and gave it five stars but now the game always crashes at 83%.You know that I lost all three times in the rage challenge without even playing a single time,just because the game crashed every single time!! I want supercell to fix this as soon as possible!!",1,2018-10-19 16:44:57
"Bad Game.. Not match making correctly.. sometimes very very hard to play the game.. today I tried 50 times.. all matchs are defeat.. they are matched highest lvl players to normal players. as well as it has server network problem.. sometimes can't to deploy troops..

"The pay to win is INSANE. The game is being managed in a terrible way, and they put more and more mechanics that makes the game unplayable if you don't put money on it. It is a lame, this game used to be great but the changes in royale pass, levels 14 and 15, the evolutions and now the second evolution on the same deck just for levels 15 are the things that made me abandon the game.",1,2024-02-07 03:42:45

But Supercell is known for ultra-micro-transactions.

Very sad to see a favorite of mine turn into a straight dumpster fire of a game.",1,2023-10-26 09:03:33
Its pretty good. I dont really like other game modes than just the trophy road but thats just my opinion.Its pretty easy to understand and it doesnt matter if your lagging that much.,4,2025-11-08 23:44:00
Update. why does my opponent have a troop that is 5 arenas higher than the arena im in. Like come on. What the frick am I supposed to do? update. I can get a 4 win streak of actual players. But then you shove a robot that has every card that goes against mine and are better. They also are placing more troops than the elixir they have. Can you not make your bots unbeatable.,1,2025-10-26 04:59:56
"Fun at first, but it becomes a snowball slowly growing to become more pay to win. You used to need to time cards in the beginning, but now you face off against people 2-4 king levels higher than you with cards you can't even unlock. You can also buy cards in higher arenas for money. It takes ages to level up cards around the 12-13 levels and the season pass is broken (overpowered). In summary, level scaling, matchmaking, and pay walls are severely damaging this game's potential.",2,2022-12-03 14:52:59
"The new reworks, rebalancing and update from Halloween 2022 disables older players to keep up with the new cards.

Overall the more you play, the more advanced you are, the less fun it is.",1,2022-10-31 14:48:06

I had it installed from the moment it was made and at first it was great, I played it with my friends and everything, and after like a year I turned it on to see what is new and they ruined it. Clan Games are ok but I think the events were enough clan games are not really needed but ok. But season pass? Seriously guys? Season pass is just pure pay to win and they added so many cards that it is really chaotic now.",3,2019-07-26 04:40:50
"Game isn't that bad, but it's not as good as it used to. The need to make money overshadowed the game itself, to the point where deals are shoved down your throat every time you get to another arena. The upcoming level 15 changes nothing, and will only make progression worse, thus more expensive. The game favors people who pay, and even then the deals are horrendous. In the end, the only people who get punished by updates are F2P players.",3,2023-03-26 18:43:41
"If you're looking for a game that pisses you off 24/7 because the developers refuse to introduce skill based and fair level match making this is the game for you.

"UNBALANCED, NOT WORTH INVESTING MONEY: They have set a sick algorithm at the backend, which never allows you to play fairly. Whatever deck you have, the other player will always have a counter to it. As you change your deck, you'll start getting opponents with different counter decks. Don't trust me, give it a try. You cannot win consistently with any of the strategy, doesnt matter how good you are. You'll never be fairly matched after 5000 trophies. Either deck or king 👑 is at max lvl.",1,2022-10-28 21:39:52

"Need even more reliable and a easy way to view the card collection.Though there is a filter to use, it still makes me to find particular cards difficult to build the decks. May be the cards could be categorized and grouped together according to their family(ex: skeletons, goblins, spells etc) . These kind of some grouping could be helpful to build decks quick.",4,2020-06-19 16:28:08
"Salty doesn't cut it. In 2020 I reviewed 5* and addictive fun. The gameplay hasn't changed much. The saltiness comes from the seasonal pass changes that on my opinion were unnecessary. I will just flatly not be paying £11.99 for rewards I was getting for under £5 just 2 days ago. On top of that, you removed the best items, books and coins from the pass. Legitimately quitting after the season ends if the changes aren't reverted. The mo ey grab is ridiculous. Thanks for the last 5 years guys...",1,2023-04-04 14:26:25
"The new update is totally dumb. It lags a lot in the new update and there's a major problem. That is once I left my clan after update it doesn't show any join button in a clan's home page. As a result, I can't join a clan now. There are also many frustrating bugs. Please try to fix this issue as soon as possible in the next update. Thank you!",3,2022-12-15 20:08:31

I'm having issues/maybe a bug where it will show me the lost internet connection but I can see my opponent move perfectly fine like there isn't an issue at all it coated me multiple games I'm not sure what to do...,2,2025-08-23 00:57:13
"Matchmaking is terrible, you're either many levels higher than your opponent and crush them, or many levels lower and get crushed. The lag causes me to lose more matches then my opponents ever could. Its pay to win, it takes decades to max out cards without paying money, and if you don't have your cards maxed out, it's impossible to get far. It used to be fun to play opponents, but it seems like there is not strategy anymore, it's just whoever's deck perfectly counters the other is the winner.",1,2020-12-23 22:00:39

"If you desperately want a game like this, search up colour clash. It's much more simple in my opinion. There are moments of ads and paying for cards and packs and stuff in colour clash... But you can still win easy without paying! There are lots of fun cards to use too. I recommend it over this dog poo. And yes. There are emotes in colour clash :)",1,2025-09-04 17:53:42
"When you sense that a player is rising too fast on the ladder, you mess with the game. I played 5 games on the trot without lag, and won all of them. As soon as the game figured I had too more trophies than usual for my level, it started to lag, and show that my internet wasnt working. Cheap tactics like this to prevent a quick rise in your ladder is a very vile move on your part. Shame on you.",1,2019-05-24 17:19:03
"It costs too much to level up your cards but not enough coins or gems for awards in battles. Update After years of playing this game, it still costs too much to upgrade when you cannot obtain enough coins. Also since the last update it is a whole lot more connection errors in the middle of the game and it makes me feel as though the game allows certain people to win because you cannot play a card. Makes it unfair and not fun anymore.",4,2021-07-28 03:26:40
"After playing this game for a bit longer, I've noticed if you get to a certain rank all I'm seeing are mega knights. I know they're easily countered by air troops but they're still very annoying and getting three matches consecutively with mega knights in them is not fun. I don't know, this is just my take on it I suppose. After many years of me writing this it hasn't changed. Just matched against 3 different people all using the same deck. Creativity is dead in this game.",1,2024-04-11 13:05:04
"I really tried liking this game. Played for a month, reached 4.2k trophies but the grind is just too much. I don't even mind the unbalanced matchmaking if I feel like I can be on their level soon but even getting gold is already a hassle. Core gameplay is good but clan wars and seasonal challenges gets really old. Dont get me started on clan wars, they want you to create unique decks. That's really cool, but you often have low levels in your collection (especially F2P). Good game, horrible greed",1,2024-07-31 09:02:15
PAY TO WINS AND EVOLUTION CARDS HAVE RUINED THE GAME. You can't play in any of the top arenas without having a pay to win with the most overpowered level 15 cards. skill does not mean anything if your opponent just places down an evo mega knight and firecracker and 3 crowns you in the first minute.,1,2025-10-10 07:24:20
This game poses as a free to play game but later on you are at a severe disadvantage as others have paid and therefore have a significant advantage. It has really fallen off in the last couple of months (especially since the king 14 update) and is not fun at this point. They made an event to make people spend all their coins and then sent king 14 out. Making lots of players spend money to stay on par with everyone else. Unless you are willing to shell out lots of money I wouldn't recommend.,1,2021-11-16 02:25:21

All that changed in the last two updates, first they allow champions to lower level players by making it to where you can buy these characters and then they raised the price of quite literally everything. The new pass give less rewards than the old one but costs about twice the price. The new cards, evolutions, are only available through paying",1,2023-06-30 07:01:50

"Ever since the update for pass royale, I haven't spent any money on the game. I would get the pass every month but now the pass is WORSE and more expensive, it's not even worth it. They don't even have trade tokens anywhere, not in the pass nor in their new season shop. On top of this they took away our party mode for 2v2 which was the only fun part of the game for non-trophy grinders to get chests and actually progress.

From my initial 5 star review it has been edited and changed to a 2 star review. I've been playing this game for 3 years now and it's never been worse than what it is right now. The algorithm is terrible and is set at such a way that it keeps you battling for hours to just gain a little bit of progress. I played a tournament at Town Hall 6 with 2600 trophies (level 6) and faced a townhall 8 with 4500 trophies. If that isn't a tad unfair then i don't know what is. Thanks for making me uninstal,2,2020-07-19 09:36:20
"ok game i started playing about a year before tower troops were added, cool cards but the main problem is balancing in both the cards and progression cause some cards are really overpowered and progression cause sometimes i play against someone 14 levels above me (especially in clan wars) also the merge royale should just be its own game it doesnt really fit clash royale also please make evolution shards easier to get. also stop being so gosh darn pay to win",3,2025-10-19 01:00:33

"Getting so sick of the updates... Changing the focus from a decently balanced strategy game to 'just adding conent' really sucks. Sure, I could use the cheap China tricks and win every match, but that's not why I liked it so many years ago. The game is currently almost unrecognizable from the thought out gameplay of... Well, even a year ago. Update after update, new b/s characters, etc. etc. Probably just going to change my work break game to something that is actually fun to play.",2,2024-06-18 02:08:33

"There was a time this game was playable and fun. That time has long passed. To specifically air my greivences, Supercell has thrown away any concept of balance, quality, or fairness in favor of predatory micro transactions, the latest wave if which is blatantly pay to win.

"I return to the game occasionally, but it's clear it's still heavily focused on monetization. While enjoyable, the player base can be extremely toxic. The matchmaking often feels rigged, pairing you against opponents designed to counter your deck, almost guaranteeing a loss. Balance is practically non-existent, especially with the introduction of new, mostly paywalled features and gimmicks. If you're willing to spend money, go ahead. Otherwise, don't expect to progress very far.",1,2025-02-18 20:58:01
"Clash Royale has suffered a severe drop in user experience, clan war gutting with level 15 being twice that of 14 to reach and evolutions being behind a 100 dollar purchase. The battle pass is not anywhere near the value it's asking for. Many offers in the store are scams ""x10 value."" The actual game is still solid but has awful balancing on evolutions, becoming a buy-in if you want to compete. I no longer recommend this game to others until these issues are addressed.",2,2023-06-28 03:12:53

"The game started out fun, but has become absolute garbage compared to what it used to be. The most recent updates have officially destroyed the game for me. In my opinion, skill is no longer needed with the new evolution cards and this once great RTS has become nothing more than playing against the exact same decks over and over again.

"It has been a good game for a while now. Many players have gotten so good that it's hard to keep up with them. If you want to be one of the top players or even close, you have to pay money. The new leveling system takes too long to any card to max. But other than that, it is a really solid game, and I keep coming back to it whenever I get free time or bored.

The game is fun for the first couple arenas before you hit a slog of over leveled players, who win because they spent money to over level their cards.

"The game has gotten terribly worse recently with everything their adding and changing. Evolutions are op and incredibly hard to get. Spending money on a game like this is waste of money.

"Horrible developers don't listen to what the community wants; they only care about how much money we can take from a player. The game is turning into ""Pay-to-win,"" not a free, friendly game.

"Started playing since beta. Stopped a couple of years ago and came back to find that the game has improved the pay to win aspect. Now with this new update, they are doubling the price of the season pass with about 10% overall increase in rewards. It's a great game concept but Supercell is trying to milk the game too much. The matchmaking algorithm is already frustrating to play as it is, and on top of that they are adding another level for us to grind/pay to try and be competitive.

The game was great back then in 2021 when King Tower level 14 until King Tower level 15 showed up in 2023 Supercell killed the game with that update couldn't upgrade most of my cards maxed out and then now 2025 there are Evolution cards pain in the butt too many cards to be nerfed. I wish this could help other people and returning players.,1,2025-09-10 16:35:28
pointless to play because the game is rigged and not meant for anybody not able or willing to give supercell their wallet. The game will intentionally match you with people who are impossible to beat because they are way over leveled for the arena to make you spend money on the game. all in all the game sucks and there is a reason it died before jynxi brought it back,1,2025-11-05 05:35:57

I don't want to go up against a level 13 card when I'm level 10 card, it's an automatic lose no matter how I edit my deck and I'm sick of it. Also people who trophy drop just to do what I'm complaining about needs to be checked.

Also, I hate how supercell keeps adding legendaries. There are 10 times more legendaries in the game than when I got it in early 2017, but the # of cards hasn't doubled.

I've been playing the game for many years and trying to get to 13 with my cards. I guess the devs run out of content and decided to increase the level capacity of the game which means that all us older players have to regather cards and go through the whole process again which I find to much at this point. I guess if you pay for the monthly pass the process will become faster but am not a player that is willing to pay to advance.

Cards need balanced. Since day 1 freeze has been over powered. This is just one example. Three muskies need a buff. In almost every deck there is a small counter.

I have never spent real money on the game, and it's almost impossible for me to progress since all I face is cards which are 2-3 levels higher than mine. This is because the game is pay to win. Matchmaking is also weird, since all I ever face is one deck which hard counters me, and when I play a deck that hard counters that deck, I never face it and instead play against a different deck which hard counters me.

Not to mention the devs have no idea how to balance cards or even make the ""Cancel match"" button work, It seems that every battle has the same cards because there are obviously better ones than others.

But that's short lived because you start getting matched up against players who not only have cards that are 2-3 levels higher than yours, but they're using Epic cards that I cant unlock for almost 1,000 or more trophies... so fun...",2,2022-11-19 08:52:28
"Ever since the evolution cards came out, it became a disaster for f2p like me. It used to be fine when it first came out but when it continued dropping loads of this nonsense evo, it has become a total wreck for high ranking players like me who don't even use evo cards.",1,2025-09-14 01:35:34

"I have played this game for nearly 3 years now, in my opinion the thing that keeps this game from being great is the lean toward pay to play. I have noticed also that match making is off, in no match making scenarios should any player lose 13 of 15 matches consecutively to lower ranks. Make the game just as enjoyable and playable for non pay to play players and the game could have a 5 star review.",2,2019-08-12 20:27:54
"Fix reconnecting in game. It's better to close and reopen the app then it is to wait for it to reconnect. Also, the clan war matchups are horrendously overleveled.",1,2025-10-19 18:43:37
"It's good fun. That was my review 2 years ago. I stopped playing for a while and then came back to it. Party modes are ruined. The game used to be somewhat pay to win, but not completely ruined like it is now. There are 2 cards that if you have you can instantly win. They need to nerf mega knight and get rid of e giant. I used to love this game but it's so hard to progress now unless you pay absurd amounts of money. I had this game at 5 stars but I can't keep it there anymore.",2,2023-05-28 22:57:56
"this game is really bad honestly,it makes me crash out a lot and u should make that when u lose u dont lose ur trophy it would make the game better and more players to come in to play u should do that to earn more money. but the clashroyale prices are crazy. wdym literally 60 gel for one ducking card bro make it more cheap or players are gonna go down soon.",3,2025-10-14 03:11:14
"Its fun for awhile, but turns into pay to win garbage. Impossible to switch decks without a huge investment so if your strategy ends up not working out, you're screwed. Have stopped playing due to the fact enemy cards were consistently 2-3 levels higher than mine.

it only lets you win a game or two after that it places you with OP players or those who pay to win you ruined the game ( that is happening at 10k trofies),1,2026-01-09 12:27:51
Great game but people are pay to win so its hard to win against them but other than that its really fun,4,2025-12-08 06:07:16
this a sweaty game with pay to win players that you can't even kill a tower that's how sweaty and bad this game is take it of the web now.,1,2025-12-09 21:03:39
Can google make this rating with no stars? hahaha too much to click for the chest. why not make one button to open all? it becomes laggy over time,1,2026-01-02 12:08:32

Level 16 was completely unnecessary. Players weren't even able to reach level 15,1,2025-11-26 21:42:45
This game was really fun but then they added level 16 and heros and is ruining there game because they wont listen to there players,1,2026-01-12 11:01:23
its a really good game and the ladder climb is a grind but the thing i hate the most is the people that use mega knight thats the only problem for me so id give a 4.5 out of 5,4,2025-11-28 05:29:10

9 years playing the game and supercell completely ruined it with the latest update. Completely pay to win.,1,2025-12-12 23:55:48
it's a fun game with many features but unfortunately it has many pay to win players,4,2025-12-25 02:15:49
Pay 2 win game that somehow takes longer to cancel matchmaking than finding a match. toxic community and a even more toxic owner,1,2025-11-27 05:13:19

"Ever since they added level 16, the game has become way too pay-to-win.",2,2025-12-20 23:49:41
The new update is downright awful . The game has shifted its entire focus to P2W players and blocked all routes of progression for F2P players . Removing EWC and Books was the worst decision ever . They completely nerfed the lucky chests and Free Pass too . Clash Royale definitely knows how to ruin an already controversial game . Uninstalling today .,1,2025-12-01 14:52:39
Great game super fun and challenging but do wish it was less pay to win,4,2025-12-05 07:47:36

"THIS IS WHY WE PLAY CLASHH Clash of Clans has maintained immense popularity for over a decade thanks to a blend of engaging gameplay, a fair monetization model, consistent updates, and a strong community focus. The core gameplay loop of building a village, training troops, and attacking others for resources is simple to understand yet offers surprising strategic depth, particularly at higher town hall levels and in competitive modes like Clan Wars and Clan War Leagues. Unlike many mobile games",5,2025-11-14 07:16:44

I hate people with cards 2 levels over mine ( most of my cards are lvl 14 9400🏆) we did NOT need lvl 16 my phone is Lucky im a calm person otherwise it would be in pieces . people's decks in midladder look like they are made by retards conclusion: 10/10,2,2025-12-04 01:45:01

It gets a bit boring after playing for quite long but it is fun overall,4,2026-01-09 18:17:34
It was a great game before. But after the update it has become worse. When ever I am in crucial situation the network lags and I loose the match this is the case in every game. I am getting frustrated with that I play other games as well but they don't lag at all don't give replies like you may have network problem as BGMI works smoothly. If it didn't get fix I will leave the game.,1,2021-11-15 21:09:14

Then just 2 months later, I reached 3000 trophies arena 10 while loving the game 😭 The game is basically just to get more towers from the opponent, than they get from you(everyone has 3 towers which is ~3000hp). to do this you use the 8 cards that you have in your deck to cycle offensive(Ex hog rider) and defensive(ex valkerye) pushes.",5,2025-11-16 21:02:43

"Bad game, don't bother. It's pay to win. You will play against higher level players all the time and get countered all the time. Even if you switch decks, you will have uneven match ups. You might win a couple of matches, then just lose just as many, if not more, right after that. Lag with card placement will lose you a lot of games even when connected to a Fiber 100mb wifi. Like most supercell games it's a but fun at the start then it's just pay to win from there.",1,2024-08-28 21:18:53

"I have been a long time player, and the most recent update is a HUGE step in the wrong direction, and comes off as money hungry and content lite. The battle pass was the one thing that did not need a rework at all, so to add such a massive overhaul and then take away all the tools by which you could level effectively while increasing max level to 15 is bonkers and insulting.

Rigged game if u get near the next arena they put you against the hardest player. Don't play this game u will get anger issues. Its also heavily p2w.,1,2025-12-02 06:02:04

"After 9 years of free to play, they finally made me quit this game I finally got two evos, and then level 16 and heros haha",1,2025-11-24 23:44:48
its just pay to win now with all the hero shards and evolution shards lol. ypu could be in the same arena as a lower level player and be outclassed simply because they purchased all the shards to make their cards OP lmao,1,2026-01-16 15:36:15
"yea it's fun but when you get to pekka all it is,is people spamming scarmy pekka witch and it's just annoying I hate this game",1,2025-12-08 16:14:08

got to a high arena game got less fun because of people just bridge spam or over level every game ever time,1,2025-12-03 22:08:06
the game is super nice and good add some offline too like you can training area,5,2025-12-10 19:22:16

"Unless you're already invested in the game, don't even bother. Greedy devs, everyone accepts that the game is p2w, except the devs greed makes the p2w worse and worse every year. If you can, just get the Chinese Clash Royale. It's better in every way.",1,2025-12-27 20:37:27
ruined the game with heroes and level 16 only good thing is merge tactics.,1,2026-01-16 08:17:08

game used to be good but it's not impossible to play because every deck is credit card cycle,2,2025-12-02 08:45:45
This game gives me so much passion to keep playing. I will not recommend this game to people who get mad. But overall it's a not fair game.,4,2025-12-03 09:49:00

Supercell for the love of god. Just listen to your community. How do you make the game worse every update? And how do you anger the community every update? Please just add back seasonal shops and have a permanent normal draft battle mode so people don't have to go againist these ptw players until you figure out how to balance your game. Or seperate the players by who pays and who doesn't. Like that should be common sense but I guess you don't like to operate like that.,1,2025-11-28 15:30:31
pay to win and meta changes like crazy I am tired of trying to be competitive and always having to spend money to do anything meaningful.,2,2025-12-09 14:23:58
It was fun at first but has become increasingly pay to win. Boo supercell,1,2025-12-22 01:11:17

so addicted. only bad part is the MEGA KNIGHT. I have been playing this game for almost 2 years. Definitely my favorite game rn,5,2025-12-07 13:31:12
this is my favorite game so you may think why 3 stars its because of all the in game purchases and the pay to win players,3,2025-11-29 23:45:50
not a friendly game for beginners. if you dont pay 400$ u will not get enough cards for next arena,1,2026-01-01 23:26:42

And arrows, now they are double fired and that's not fair because it can destroy high level troops whether skeletons, archers or else troops like that. Lower level arrows can destroy high level, I found it not good or fair card. Work on it.",2,2021-01-17 19:10:01

"This game just keeps on getting worse. The new update is an obvious cash grab. Don't let your kids around your wallet with this game because you will pay. update 2025 they killed the game, nothing but hog, firecracker, mega knight decks with either electric dragon or valkyrie. Evolutions are just spells mixed in and everything is totally unbalanced. They killed golem and the log. They buffed electric giant to withstand hits from megaknights for 7 exiler but nothing for golem. Killed this game👎",1,2025-11-28 09:03:19

"The latest update has ruined the game. They've made it more favored for Pay To Win by removing seasonal shop rewards. Was the only reason I'd still play to higher trophies, now you can only get a Evolution after 6 months! Prior was 3 which waa fine but now I'm afraid they've lost the plot. Devs, go look at Angry Birds and Plants vs Zombies, they like you, went to far into monetization and they killed their game and Revenue (its all you care about). Would give 0 out 5 if I could.",1,2025-04-08 19:10:58

With every bigger update the game becomes more and more pay to win. It's sad to see it go down this path,3,2025-11-26 01:20:16
this is honestly an unfair game because it either bots that are op because I watch clash a lot and the bots are spaning giant and royal knights and pekka not even stopping no joke im not mad im telling the truth and I if its not then its op people because I see people with higher lvl emotes and titles which is unfair and others pls clash fix this cause this is stupid.,1,2025-12-12 15:45:05

The fanbase is more divided than ever about level 15 and the introduction of yet another pass (which is just a cash grab anyways for play-to-win players). This game won't have much left to give soon enough for the average player, just like many other games nowadays.

Would be 5 but the game is pay to win since the evo shards beame so hard to get. For free,3,2025-12-15 14:44:07
"the only ones that will give this game a high review now are the wallet warriors and the new players, this game has devolved from a decent game to a very much pay to win/advance, every screen in the game wants you to buy something, the game is throttled for non players, though supercell will of course denigh this, but the increasing number of low ratings so I'm not the only one that thinks this, the higher up you go in the game the more unbalanced it becomes, level 11 players will expect to go against level 12 and 13 opponents with maxed out cards on a regular basis, I started a new run just to see what the lower levels are like now and found the game play to be the same, my lvl 2 account was pitted against lvl 3 and 4 accounts with cards that were level 4, 5 and 6 cards against my lvl 2 and 3 cards. if not for the years of play and all the money I used to put in to this game I would delete it right now as I no longer enjoy playing and play more as a habit although the more pay to win and advance it becomes the closer I get to just saying FK IT,",1,2020-10-24 00:12:11

Says update and you cant. Had max cards and now they come out with level 14 is pretty sad. There is no point in making us upgrade every card again. Some cards are so over powered. The targeting in game needs work. There were things they could have fixed. Instead they cared more about making us all spend very sad.

"The game is fun, but there are hackers and other people that constantly split out things. I had a guy that went against me and played two 5s and a 4! That is not possible in the arena I am in! I am in spell valley. Also the game needs to fix it to were the trophies can't go down. People can get stuck. I am stuck at spell valley because I'll win a few and lose more. Please fix this! It will make your game more pleasing!",2,2022-03-21 00:26:34

Deleting this game. The server is too slow which makes the game unfair.,1,2026-01-06 19:37:39
After playing for years the game has gotten kinda repetitive with new characters being similar to characters already in the game. The micro transactions have also soured the game making it more pay to win and even player customization seems like a cash grab. It's still playable without paying money but I just wish the gaming industry would stop trying to siphon every penny they can out of their player base.,3,2021-11-02 12:07:23

Units are constantly being rebalanced to keep game play interesting.  Great game!",5,2018-12-31 20:03:29

"The game is quite addictive, I have been playing for close to a year and a half and I haven't gotten bored of it yet, although progress is slow after 5k if you don't spend money and play meta decks. For new players I would suggest using easy to play decks that have a ton of outplay potential when you get better like log-bait (which I play w/ 6.2k trophies) and find a YouTuber who plays that deck on top ladder (Ryley_cr for log bait). I highly recommend this game for smart people who like gaming.",4,2023-03-28 01:17:40

With the update having evolutions it started going downhill. Now, just like any game it seems like, whatever new character that comes out is buffed way too much and you have to pay in some way to get it or you're going to lose. No way around that.

Unfair play is a big issue, and it feels like even in arena 12 it is impossible to progress and use cards I enjoy because a card costing 2-3 elixir can wipe out all of my cards at once.

Don't waste your time with this ""game"", because the only thing this game will give you is disappointment, resentment, and a face full of pay-to-win advertisements.

you only get to play against players in way higher level the you are You should change Name to PAY TO WIN,1,2025-12-10 22:01:32
You dont get out played anymore. You get out leveled by a level 10 with max level cards. The game isnt fair with its matchmaking and that is very obvious. It should be a combination of trophies and level. Not just trophies. Because like myself I can only go so high in trophies until I just get beaten not by skill but by the level of cards. Its not fun anymore. I'd rather wait another 10 seconds to find a match then find one in one second but go up against a maxed out person that I cant beat.,2,2019-12-11 22:57:05
This game has been great for since it started but recently it is more and more clear they do not care about core players and instead would rather just keep upping price for sub par material. The decisions supercell has made lately have negatively affected the play and progression of the game in exchange for a straight up cash grab. All whales are welcome!,1,2023-04-07 04:16:24
"Don't play this game, it is the most pay-to-win abomination in existence, there is no possible explanation for why I have to constantly go against deck 5 levels over me. This trash is rigged and will only give you mental issues, save yourself the pain and avoid it.",1,2025-09-27 18:46:49
The game is good but the developers are making it more and more pay to win by adding things that increase the time it takes to max out to the point where its impossible to get there without paying money. Also the matchmaking feels unfair a lot of the time. Your opponents are either a lot higher or lower level then you and those matches are just not fun. Rarely will you get opponents where your odds of winning are even making it a fair fight. Hope you found this helpfull,2,2023-08-25 04:24:31
"Tried to like it... but it's Hateful... Playing games constantly with people spamming units always on demand, always higher levels and constantly playing games with people who have the ability to launch 3 units at once and faster elixir. I tried to like the game but it is designed to wind you up to pay to win. I reached level 10 and I was put against people with much higher units (12 or 13) as standard. Nothing says getting beat by higher level units constantly to make you button a game.",1,2021-04-13 18:54:09
"I've been a long-time fan of this game, but the once skewed match making system has become 100% a ploy for pay to play. There is no way to excel past a certain level without spending gobs of money on the latest potions, cards, or whatever gimic they use to create imbalance in the game. This imbalance makes it impossible to win without spending. Don't waste your time on this game.",1,2023-04-03 00:53:25

"The game can be fun, but it just takes forever to upgrade the cards to high levels if you're not planning to spend money. So, you're gonna lose over and over to opponents with higher-level-cards until you realize it's actually not fun. I get that the devs need to make money from this well-crafted game, but there's a difference between making money and milking it. I really think the devs are milking the game way too much right now.",1,2023-08-12 06:14:12
"The game used to be fun, really. But the matchmaking is horrid. The way it always goes, is that you go really far up with trophy, and then, you get such a set back because someone uses cards that 1. You don't even have and 2. Are literally 2-3 levels higher than yours. Another issue is that the game basically is pay to win, or grind without looking back. I never buy in app purchases, but this game is literally punishing me because of that. 1/2",1,2021-09-04 05:26:48
this game is so bad that the players teasing you and laugh at you and and I don't like how all the players lose the trophy a lot do not play clash royal ever again or else this game could make you miserable and angry so do not play this game its boring and stupid,1,2026-02-05 09:16:20

extremely unbalanced until you have max cards which takes a very long time. when you have an equal match same level cards and towers then its a much better game. more about strategy and less about being over matched. It's like sitting down to play chess but having to kill their queen twice. Just doesn't make for a fair game. they should match people based on equipped card level average and tower level. on the positive side it is very quick and easy to play.,3,2019-08-01 20:26:39
"This game is easily the worst of $upercells. Showing their true greed in the game in every single game. It's been years since I last played, but the game is somehow worse. Evolutions and Champions and new towers all add even more pay to win, alongside the ease of over leveling your units to beat free to play players. I hoped to try the goblin mode, but that's locked to a trophy range I just can't feasibly get to without insane grind. I uninstalled yet again. Thanks for the awful experience.",1,2024-06-27 03:43:34
"This game use to be my favourite game. It is definitely not even near the top 5 anymore because of how P2W it is. Even if we put P2W aside and focus on other things, there are still numerous problems with the game. The point is when a company that owns a game gets too greedy (only thinking about money), that's when the game becomes bad and difficult to enjoy. There are still some positive stuff. They recently added new troops and towers, which has not happened in quite some time.",2,2024-06-25 15:49:20
"It's not a pay to win, it's a pay to make progress. I'm playing with level 6 cards, the game puts me against opponents who have got level 13 cards. It's virtually impossible to win (unless your opponent is an idiot). So now I've reached a stage where I'm stagnated because I lose most of the times. I can't even touch any of my opponent's towers most of the times. So it's now the funless game I've ever played. The only way to keep making any progress in the game is to spend real money on cards",1,2020-09-26 17:50:01
"Truly frustrating. Ever since the second last update the game lag so much in my phone the game is practically unplayable. I can start the 2vs2 match and watch the game lag. When I tried to put down the first card one of my tower is already destroyed. I have a ASUS ZenFone 3 zoom and it is only 3 years old. Supercell has to fix this as I played this game for 6 years and I am about to quit. I don't think I am the only one. Update: I got a new phone, and it is working good.",3,2021-02-25 01:46:01
"Match making is HORRIBLE. My highest card is lvl 11and the majority of my games I am facing people with lvl 13 or lvl 13+. So when I go to try and win a chest I loose a ton of trophies until I finally get a match at my level, which is still not a guaranteed win. It is absolutely ridiculous that I see that many people with troops two levels higher than me. It is NOT fun. If you are low level, stay that way. The game is totally pay to win and no fun for the casual player. Go somewhere else",1,2021-01-18 09:44:39

"This is the worst game ever, you work hard and collect trophies with your skills, then they will make you fight with higher level players, their bot says that this is fair game policy, after 10 seconds players of 3 levels above or below come, for the last 350 games, top level players are always coming to me and that too within 3 to 5 seconds.",1,2026-02-13 16:11:07
"Been playing since it came to the states. Over the years, it's only gotten worse. Poorly balanced cards, money-grab matching. P2W doesn't even begin to cover it. Glitchy mechanics with a failure of the devs to fix any of these issues. Used to be great. Now the devs have to keep adding bot accounts for the few remaining players to go up against. Just shut it down, fellas.",1,2024-04-12 08:42:28
"man I thought it was bad in 2023...I came back after years to see microtransations have gone insane. but the core gameplay was surprisingly enjoyable until I reached 10k. I guess I didnt truly understand the evolution and champion system until then because I uninstalled after only a week of my return. It's still pay to win plain and simple, but its so..so much worse now. free to play players have no chance and are in fact punished for not spending money",1,2026-02-08 14:08:18
"it's good, but I'm missing something they did: All cards for 2v2s.

Have been playing since the beginning but this games balancing has honestly gotten so bad. Couple that with the necessity to spend money to get the newest champions or evolutions and it's just not that fun anymore.

I moved on, but after about a week total, i have hit a brick wall in the form of opponents with consistently +1/+2 levels in the entire deck, as well as +1 level king tower.

"Clash Royale used to reward skill and strategy, but now it heavily favors players who spend money.

"The most important part of this game is the opponents matching which is not working fair. I played the game long time ago for a long time and end up to uninstall it and now I gave it a try and it's still the same.

"this would be a great game if the matchmaking was truly random and it wasnt so extremely pay 2 win . instead of getting in a match with a random, once the algorithm detects your on a winning streak, it will start sending you hard counters to your deck game after game forcing you to change your deck to something entirely different or just outright paying for higher tier cards. most pay 2 win game I've ever played.",1,2026-02-11 20:06:56

It's so sad to see have to really dislike a game that I once enjoyed so heartily with so many friends. (Happy hunting Supercell for those kids with their parents credit cards)",1,2019-11-28 20:48:07
"I've been playing this game for 7 years. This game is a scam and the devs lean into the game's toxicity banking on antagonizing people's emotions in the hopes of leading them to spend (most of the time, their parent's money). I bet google play will delete my honest review.",1,2025-11-15 05:48:05
"Honestly? Fantastic game. I was one of the first in the game in the Legendary arena when it first came out. Here's the problem. STOP PUSHING OUT SPLASH DAMAGE CARDS!!!! No one wants to play against some random overpowered card that can't be beaten that every single player in the game uses. Firecracker and Little Prince ruined the game for me. After 7 years of constant playing, I think my time here is done. Thanks for ruining a fantastic game supercell🤙",2,2023-11-08 11:47:18

I now lose more crowns against a level 13 (I'm level. 12) then i win against a level 13, I'm not sure if this is a bug in the game but it needs to get fixed ASAP.

you can't win any games unless you spend hundreds of dollars a month. I am a free to play player and I am at 15k trophies and in league 5 and I have played for roughly 5 years and I have friends catching up to me with 2 months of experience because they spend hundreds of dollars.

"More money for the money hogs! The entire game has been shaped by its pay to win practices, leaving you high and dry whether you decide to buy in or not. Either give your money to Supercell (total lowlife losers), or try your best to not spend any money at all (like I have) and suffer the slough of toxic players that bought in. The game doesn't even have the same charm it used to anymore, so there's hardly any reason to play anymore. The surveys asking what they can change are hilarious too.",1,2026-02-08 20:46:12

Don't waste your time downloading this app unless you are willing to pay the monthly prescription. When I first got it over 3 years ago it was OK but it has slowly turned into all about paying each month to get the best cards those that don't pay are just in it to make the premium players feel good for justifying the cost is think this game is almost turned into a form of gambling as you are required to pay money not knowing what you will get in return it is very addictive.,1,2019-10-01 19:58:38
"Game used to be so fun until I realized how pay to win this really is. I used to be so in love with this game, I was in master II and I was determined to get on the leaderboard. That is until I realized it was nearly impossible without gemming chests and cards. There comes a point in this game where it becomes impossably pay to win way worse than the other supercell games.. I wouldnt mind the pay to win part, although this game is introduced as a free to play stratergy that takes only skill.",1,2021-01-20 11:15:56
"I got the game on the day it came out. It was amazing. Kept my 5 star rating for 8 years. However, ever since the last few updates, not only is it slower and lags at times, but it is clear the game is now pay to win with the new elite cards, evolutions and others. Furthermore, too many new cards are added to make us buy or change the decks and then nerfed. Its repetitive and annoying. For these reseaons, I have no choice but to give 1 star and stop playing for the time being. I'll stick to CoC.",1,2024-01-16 19:16:50
"This was once an amazing game to play, and it still handles the same but this addition of seasons was just micro-transactions disguised as a monthly cost. The game play has become stagnant at best and with a solid majority of people paying to play in order to increase their gold and cards earned it lacks any real challenge these days. The business model seemes to have changed for supercell over these many years as they are doing this with all their games. Guess it's one way to make a quick buck.",3,2020-05-19 21:57:30
"By the time you get to 6k trophies no skill is needed because ptw Timmy spent $135 to max his deck. This wouldn't be an issue if the game would have a good progression, but they spam the same shop offer for $20 and say it's 50X value. I would recommend this game to people that like to spend money to feel superior to others. If you don't want to spend too much I recommend getting 5k trophies and just doing challenges. And don't forget broken evos that can take 6 months to get without spending🤭",1,2024-06-24 12:06:26
"Great game with amazing mechanics but heavily rigged for players who spend too much money. Sketchy practices from the company happen often, like the most recent ""Slash Royale"" event. Didn't notify players that about a new level, and now players spent coins on cards they won't be able to use. Really should be some sort of compensation or boost to coins that you can get to make leveling up less tedious then it already is (before slash royale only had 8 maxed cards after playing the game 4+ years).",3,2021-11-02 00:25:21

"Too much clicking and animation Thsi used to be a fun game, and the game play is still fun, but to progress you need to win and open prizes, and they have started introducing more animation and boxes that one needs to open in order to get the rewards. The first couple of times it is fun, but after a few thousand times it is pointless and you can't disable it. It seems to be aimed at 2 year olds. We just want to play and get rewards, not spend most of the time waiting for the animation to finish.",2,2025-03-07 21:39:36

"I have played this game for nearly 4 years now on a daily basis. The levels are challenging to begin with and card collection is key to the best character and can be done f2p, albeit slowly. The devs pay attention to the community and are quick to make changes when and where needed. The fifth star was lost in the last year. The team stagnated on innovation and the reworked Clan War (and subsequent patch/tweaks) was and is an overall disappointment. The game still entertains and I recommend it!",4,2021-02-18 14:35:03
"2 years later and while Im still casually playing, my review doesn't change. I guess both Supercell and I are okay with mediocrity. You get to a point where you are maxed out and their algorithm decides how many games in a row you can win. Eventually you just starting getting match after match of opponents that have the exact same deck that is a perfect counter for yours. You switch decks and magically your match counters that. It forces you to disengage with the app.",2,2019-06-29 20:23:22

"New update ruined the game. Only way to farm chests now is to risk losing trophies. They've also made the pass royale silly as you can't get a guaranteed card upgrade anymore, not that you need it, since they've capped every game mode except trophy road; which is taking away from one of the points of the game. The new tokens update is also dumb, you need to spend gems in order to buy the best thing in the shop, as the season doesn't allow you to obtain enough tokens.... disappointed.",2,2023-04-04 13:44:03
Super Cell does nothing about all of the cheating especially elixire boost cheats going on in this game. People spend more real money to compete with all of the Cheaters.

Very much pay to win should make it less pay to win if you have the patience to wait several days to go up a arena because the people you play against have 3 lvls higher cards then you go ahead but if you don't wanna spend a lifetimes worth of money or time then I would not recommend this game,2,2025-10-11 22:43:59
Game was good but you have to have a lot of money or years to level your cards. And with the new update all they made 1v1 now with less and Rewards. But the 1v1 sucks no leveling your cards there all lvl11 I think after the long time and money I spent on this game to get a champion card or one of the new cards would be nice. But good luck. Most of my cards can go up in level but the gold you need to do that is ridiculous. It would cost 100s of dollars to level them( real money).,1,2022-10-27 22:39:18
Evolution cards ruin the game for free to play players. If you arent willing to spend $10 per card to get the upgraded version then it puts you at a major disadvantage. After a certain point it is nearly impossible to climb because you go against evolution cards that outperform every other card. Do not recommend to anyone who is free to play or anyone who likes a relaxing game.,1,2025-02-18 16:23:56
This game is very fun to play. The start is rewarding and the further you get the high your skill needs to be. The only problem is that you are forced to pay to win if you want to keep up with your opponents.,4,2025-08-31 01:19:05
"This game used to be really fun and addicting but now everything in their updates is cash grab after cash grab. This update that's coming they're taking things away from free to play players, raising the price of the gold pass, and adding a new $12 pass.

Cooldowns are too high, matchmaking in the whole game is a nightmare, people pay to win, the addition level 14 is stupid, and the navigation of the clan menu is terrible now. I hope they revert to the first Clan Wars and fix the game entirely because it is utterly broken. Also, SuperCell's account security is terrible and one of my accounts got hacked.

I understand there aren't really that many players and you have to use a lot of bots, but if they're going to have pixel perfect precision, at least make their cards like 2-4 levels lower so it's fair. I don't think you understand. I have 1 level 13 and 5 level 12 and I'm almost level 13...",1,2020-12-11 14:39:56
it is just so fun and I will probably not get to 10k trophies but I will try I will rate this 5 stars,5,2026-02-08 01:56:16
Game crashes during inconvenient times when the time is critical. I probably lost 20% of my lost games because a 10 second crash occurred. It's been happening to me more often as of the late. Clan war match ups are terrible watching lvl 8s fight lvl 13s. It's a great game but the designers seem more focused on new cards then fixing the terrible clan wars matchmaking system. It also appears I'm not the only one with crash issues. If you need a time killer this is it with a healthy dose of salt.,1,2019-05-18 06:58:54
"Used to be 4 stars, changed it to 1 because of SO MUCH P2W. Progress is super slow for people that dont spend money on this game.

The matching in the game is horrible. I am a level 4 and consistently fight people 2 to 4 levels higher then me. There are some bugs like the bomber will get stuck on the tower and not throw his bomb. I could list out about 20 other issue with things not working correctly. In a game this mature these things should be worked out. it hasn't gotten much better. Matching still sucks and there are still one of issues.,1,2019-01-29 05:53:54
"This game is garbage now, unless you pay a bunch of money to get all your stuff leveled up they will continue to matchmake you against people with 2 or 3 level higher units and make it impossible to climb. Especially when a win rewards you as much as a loss hurts you. If you are an average player and go 50/50 you will never progress in the game to unlock more cards. Bad design now. Need to take a page out of marvel snaps book.",1,2024-04-16 05:23:24
"It's a fun and addicting game once you get the hang of it.. but not so user friendly for beginners. Some comments that developers could look into: When dropping card characters on the battle arena, cards such as the Log or the Barbarian Barrel seem to take too long at times before they actually drop. It gets annoying especially at crucial moments when a split second could mean victory or defeat. Also seems unfair that a lower king tower level player is matched up against a higher level player..",3,2019-08-23 21:27:39

I like how new cards are added once in a while, to spice it up a bit, and keep things interesting, my only problems are how much the game has become ""pay to win"". My other problem is how many Evolutions are being added. at this rate, every card will have an evolution of its own in no time.",5,2024-07-07 06:32:09

There is no more skill involved. It all depends on what kind of troops ur oponent has. Totally killed the concept and fun by introducing troops discreminately.

After 2022 or so I felt that the developers wanted to do something to keep players engaged and i thought, ""oh they'll make it more skill-based, fair and fun"". But instead they made it more pay to win. Paying to win a strategy game makes no sense.. It would be cool if u can pay for skins (of the troops), towers, banners, stuff like that which doesn't affect gameplay.

If you're max level all it does is give you gems, and not even $20 worth. Cmon guys that's just a burn, and if you don't get the pass, good luck getting champions.

I always get paired up with players with maxed out cards. While I only have 1 lvl 13 card. It's frustrating to lose just because your opponent has higher level cards.

"I just wished I could battle opponents of my level from time to time. Not only tower level, cards level average too. It's frustrating having to play against much stronger opponents 100% of the time. Also, when a match ends in a draw, even if your tower is just a couple of shield points away from your opponent's, you loose. But when your towers are 2 levels below your opponent's, it means YOU inflicted more damage to your opponent's towers than the other way around percentage-wise. You should win",1,2024-08-11 20:25:39
Had a problem and contacted customer service through their in-game messaging app to recover my account. Terribly inefficient and frustrating and ultimately unsuccessful. 2020 update: came back to the game and I'm horribly under leveled. You can't outplay someone who's got higher level cards and there's no catch up mechanic besides mega $$$. Sure cards are capped at 9 for tournaments but I can't level cards up quickly so I'm still 2 to 3 levels behind. It's pay to win if you're new. NTY.,1,2020-01-23 01:11:46

"2v2 matchmaking is horrible. So many players deliberately play or don't play so you lose and have no consequences. Now it's 8/2025 and still nothing has been done about these players ruining the match. Instead they punished me with a timeout if I leave the match because my random partner refuses to play, how stupid. Is it any wonder this game is failing and has turned into a pay to win.",1,2025-08-31 23:48:00

"Graphics and characters are cool. Downside of the game its a buy to level up game. No matter how long, or hard you play it takes forever to get what you need. Worst part of this game is the connection. I've been playing for like 6-7yrs an this years the worst (unistall). I understand everyone has different networks but none of the creators thought of a boot off option? If my network is not running at the speed of my opponent, I think the game should kick me instead of wasting time to play.",1,2024-11-27 01:02:24
to much network issues and take longer time to load matches 😓😓,1,2025-12-23 22:00:47
The game is good but the way they extort money is very bad. The fundamental concept of this game is amazing but.. recently they've added level 15 which made max progression to 1/3 of the total progression in an instant. You'd have to spend more then 25000$ if you want to max a new account which is ridiculous. The gold is scare and the pass cost has been tripled with even less value for money. Don't play this game unless you can spend 10 years dedicated full time on maxing your account.,1,2023-06-21 10:11:32
as of now even as a max lvl 15 player I would not recommend this game. Just pure greed no idea what the community wants.,1,2025-11-25 00:35:07
"Its literally the best game i had ever played in my entire life, but like the thing is most things like evos and others are literally in the item shop that cost real money making this a P2W game mostly. Would have been 5 star but i have to give u this, im sry",4,2025-10-26 18:36:30

"Not a good game for players looking for a fair competetive game (Unless you have $100+ dollars to spend on micro-transactions, then it's a fun game with easy wins I suppose). Card leveling system conpletely ruins the point of a rating system. Not including the fact that higher level cards are inherently better, it takes more resources to defend against pushes. In a game where your resource management determines your games, it becomes unplayable.",1,2020-11-07 03:09:24
"While I once enjoyed this game and played it quite often, I can't deny that it is for better or worse a simple luck of the draw card game, wherein the victor is almost always decided through who has what, rather than an in depth strategy of any kind.

"I think it's a terrific game,but the reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because it crashes a lot. I have been playing it since 2 years but off late the number random app crashes has increased a lot.

I originally played this game back in 2016 along with my Clan from Clash of Clan then left after a year. I just came back last year to the game and I was enjoying it even if I needed to start from the beginning since I lost my old account. I was enjoying the game before the last update. Now I don't have any motivation or reason to keep continuing playing the game specially that the progression now has been cut in half. It was fun while it lasted.,1,2025-04-08 07:35:44
New to this game. Game itself is pretty fun. Bummer I pay for the Pass Royale to learn at the end of the season its only good for that season!! How is that not stated in the nice little info button you provide. Should state that it's a membership fee of $5 + tax monthly.. What a Joke! Not sure if I'm going to keep playing or not.,2,2019-08-05 19:03:30
Game is boring you play the same thing over and over again. Supercell doesn't care about the everyday normal players just the pros and then the people who can't come up with thier own ideas go to YouTube and suck the dick off the pros and play what they post cause thats the only way to actaully win. Playing your own thing or trying to play your own thing is impossible. This pos shouldn't have a 4.3 star it should be at 3 considering the the first 1000 comments are 1 star.

"It's a great game for $5 a month in the beginning levels. . Once you get to level 15 you have to spend money in order to keep up and be able to compete. . In order to compete Beyond level 15 you have to spend an absurd amount of money. . It's an ingenious business that gets the customers hooked, then we have to spend money to keep up in the game. .

"There are 2 major problems with ranked matches. First, there isnt really any prevention for bullies. That is to say, a level 10 should not be facing a level 12 or 13. Second, it doesnt make much sense for one player to deal 5000 damage while the other deals 3000 damage and the later player win the game. Would love to see these issues fixed.",4,2019-07-01 15:39:44
"Game is super fun. Issue I run into is it seems like everyone I play has unlimited stamina or whatever you call. People put here throwing 7 cards, 2 3s and a 4 at the same time. Mathematically it makes absolutely no sense unless the game doesn't always match you with real players. Edited because someone just popped a giant, a big minion and flyers all at once. That's 15 energy all at once. This game is fake. And you don't lose skills when demoted ranks either. That's so overpowered",1,2022-11-08 21:19:08
"This game is cool. I have played this a lot when i was a kid. But, i feel like some cards need to be nerfed. For example, The Princess card. Her elixir cost is too low. That way, people can make spamming decks, so they can have multiple Princesses. Also, The Mega Knight. I actually like that card. But, i think it has too much health. Maybe lower his health a little bit. But, still, i really enjoy this game. Even tho, i hate people that don't play the game correctly... 4/5 Stars",4,2022-08-04 15:31:22
"It was great before the update for clan wars 2. Nothing makes sense!

"I've played this game on and off since release. Save yourself time and especially money and stay away. Horrible balancing and updates all focused around you spending more money. Cards will be horribly unbalanced for literally years. Some cards are terrible and never used, others, like Hog Rider, have been in every deck for the last 5 years. Atrocious game design. Stay far away",1,2021-10-29 02:10:19
"I can agree, this game is fun and addictive, but it literally doesn't work at all for players with Android phones that despite being compatible, still have the app crash every 5 minutes, making it impossible to play any normal matches without the game crashing, and you coming back on to see the match you entered already be finished. This makes new players stray away from the game, as they can't complete a regular match, because their app crashes, the match continues, and they come back to a loss",3,2021-11-11 05:00:06

"Love this game! But the recent update has screwed up. In between games, it abrupty asks me to retry login 2 times without any network loss or any prior disturbance, and just 2 mins back, It was my first loss in the royal challenge because of a bug where it showed that I destroyed the tower during overtime (but not really) and the game continued while I couldn't do anything but stare at the camera zooming out without being able to see or use my cards. It sucks to get a bug when it matters so much",3,2021-04-10 23:18:56
"If I'm being perfectly honest the gameplay is fun and I don't see any major bugs with it. My issue with it is how harshly your punished for losing and who they put you against. I mean if the game is gonna put you against someone it should be somebody of the same level with similar leveled cards. I mean it's kinda difficult to win if the enemy has level twelve cards while you have level nine. Otherwise is a fun game to get engrossed in, just be prepared for a lot of setbacks.",3,2022-12-09 21:42:58
this game is NOT fun.I play it because it is the single most addictive thing on the face of the earth. and whenever I start to have a tiny bit of fun a mega nga gets dropped right in front of my smiling little face whipping the shear happiness from my life. this is why so many teens/young adults are falling i to depression. and this highly influences people to start abusing alcohol. you can't stop playing it because it releases so much dopamine and its basically D1 rage bait.

It was my favorite game by far, but as time went on I started to notice it was the same thing over and over. the updates would overpower cards and then next update they would nerf that card into complete oblivion.

"Its fun for a while but once you get to higher levels it becomes massively pay to win. I could deal with that even, but the worst part is constantly being matched with people of higher levels where you have an insanely low chance of winning.. And as the game progresses you see less and less creativity in deck building and everyone uses the same cards. I like to call them ""no skill"" decks. Toxic.",2,2020-09-01 04:39:51

It also seems to happen more if the opponent is a member of a clan.",2,2025-02-11 01:43:42

This game was fun when it first came out and then the developers got greedy and now it's paid to win every month a new evolved card that's the usually the most overpowered thing in the game just to get you to spend money and what was once a game that took skill and strategy It is now a game of luck and no skill. Then they take cards that are already some of the strongest in the game and make them stronger while the car is that no one plays don't get touched for years.

You could pay to get the good legendaries, or wait until you get lucky enough to get a decent one. And basically if you dont have any decent legendaries and the other player does, its pretty much a guaranteed loss, making it hard to win when it seems everyone has everything good and you have nothing.

"This game is very much pay-to-win, as once you get to the somewhat higher arenas, you cannot experiment with your decks and use them in competitive play, as the levels of your cards determine EVERYTHING in the gameplay, so unless you pay money to level up the cards you want to use, yo have to do card quests that take a long time to complete or unlocking chests which don't guarantee the cards you need, and the offers in the shop can get ridiculous, going up to hundreds of dollars.",2,2023-12-30 13:55:59
The game is now unplayable. If you manage to make it to 3600 trophies you're stuck and can't go backwards. That means you're stuck with all the above average or pay-to-play players who kill you in every match. This makes it impossible to progress unless you also pay or grind chests for weeks/months to try and get a foothold up to 3800 trophies. How pathetic. Get rid of the update so we can go backwards and hone our skills so we can try to progress.,1,2019-08-11 00:40:21

"Im a free to play player, but a lot of the time I come across pay to plays who have several legendaries and almost fully leveled cards. Its unfair the huge advantage they get, and I hope thats fixed soon, it can make the game less fun. It also takes forever to fill chest slots and unlock chests if you dont pay to get gems which makes the game take long to play.",4,2018-12-05 22:42:19

"I've been playing this game since it first came out. And I'd really like to defend it. But I gotta say, sometimes, too many changes isn't good. I know they're trying to keep the game relevent and interesting but rn, there are about 10-15 decks that are top tier and can beat any other deck. So only those who use these meta decks can hang in the big leagues. Gone are the days where you could create your own deck and go to battle.",3,2023-11-21 20:10:25

"It was really, really fun for a few days. Then you hit an incredible wall where you just can't get further. It's obvious this wall exists to try and get you to spend money. You win less and started raging more, until you cave in and spend money in the hopes of winning again. I eventually just asked myself: ""Why am I still playing this game if it's just making me angry?"" And uninstalled. I'm glad I only wasted a few days playing this and didn't spend any money. Quit while you still can!",2,2019-10-11 20:03:14
the game is rigged first it's easy and the more you progress you see it gives you one weak player and then like two p2w strong player and you loose and make you want to play more and it's disgusting I've be one match away from wining and it strong weak strong weak again and again and I'm not progressing this game is trash and insanely p2w don't recommend downloading it,1,2025-11-14 01:25:03

"This game is one of the worst I've ever played. Balance? Nowhere to be seen, some cards are too strong, others too weak. Pay to win? Yep, that's all there is to it. Buy that 5$ pass if you want to win ALL your games until you get to play vs another pass player and that's when it becomes fair. Stay away from this game, you can only have fun if you reach highest level after 4 years of constant playing.",1,2022-01-19 01:35:21

Good concept and used to be a good game. Yeah its better then before but 99% of players are on the other side of the world and are toxic as hell. I can't play a single round without being frozen for half the game because of bad connection. And there is no option to start over so I'm at a disadvantage for being an old returning player.,2,2022-01-23 21:49:01
"This game is a terrible waste of time. The progression system is flawed to the point that you don't even have a slight chance of catching up when starting an account. You can waste thousands of dollars to level up in order to play fair matches, but for what? The gameplay is infuriating, repetitive, and often times unfair. Not only that, but nothing fresh is ever introduced. I played this game from release until now, and the base game is UNTOUCHED! DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!",1,2023-09-28 05:45:10

"Every update makes the game more and more unplayable. With the current update, if you were to start playing right now, you will never have an opportunity to unlock the new level 15 cards. This update is by far the worst in recent times. If you save every single coin earned throughout the game, it will still take 2 seasons, or 2 months, to upgrade a singular card to level 15. And you need to be max level 15 before that's even a possibility.",1,2023-06-20 05:59:23
"It's normally fun but they purposely let you progress into an arena (where you are under leveled) very easily so you cannot progress without spending money to upgrade. At this point you are forced to pay out or grind the season shops for the better part of a year to even gain one level in your deck. You cannot go down arenas after progressing, getting you stuck somewhere progression is impossible.

"I played this game for years and I really don't know why. It's mediocre in pretty much every sense. Monitization is invasive but not terrible, gameplay is fine, game runs well on every device I have tried it on etc. The game is a mix of chess and clash. It feels tactical but is also casual. It is also really grindy for a pvp game. Leveling your cards makes a huge difference and balance has always been shotty but there is always counterplay.",3,2021-12-01 04:52:26
"quality production from supercell. Addictive and time consuming. After 4 months plus of gaming time, the biggest problem is you can't do grinding, wanting to up level on all cards are very time consuming and often times when you tryout new decks the levels of cards won't be high enough to be competitive.

"This is actually a pretty fun game to play, but I'm having an issue. So I've been playing this game on and off for years, slowly leveling all of my cards up, not really focusing on a primary deck since there is usually some kind of new card, and now I'm being matched against players of the same king tower level, or higher, who have higher card levels than I do. I'm not sure if I'm the only one who has this issue, and once I max my cards out it won't matter, but maybe you can look into this?",1,2022-12-28 04:15:24
"Definition of a P2W game, to say it's unbalanced is an understatement. Even at low levels you'll face people with ridiculously overleveled decks which makes it impossible to win even if they're not playing accurately, the game forces you to spend more and more money in order to make actual progress. It's one thing to pay for a game you genuinely enjoy, and another to be forced to pay in order to ""enjoy"" the game.",1,2023-09-23 05:16:18
"It's a good game but there are some characters which are too overpowered like mega -knight , which make another player very difficult to win the match . so , I request the Officials to either reduce their power or make their availability easy so that every old player can own them . this is the only reason I am giving it 1 stars .",1,2025-10-12 17:16:57

"It's a great game. For the past 6 years the game haven't changed alot, and this is what makes it a good game. The games focus are battles and while it may sound boring, cards and some minimal updates makes it likeable. There are over 100 cards in the game and different gamemodes to make colourful. I recommend buying the Pass Royale once, it gives you huge progress and you buy it once its mostly enough. Free tower skin, free emotes and free evolution. Gives you a boost for life.",4,2024-07-03 19:52:56
"Played for 3 years consistently. Lag switchers are a major issue in the game. The new update for Clan Wars 2 has the app crashing every 3 seconds on me. I can't donate cards and I can't even see this new ridiculous update they made to the game. It's hard to find a decent game without it being pay to win, and all of the microtransations that they throw in the game, so that you can GAMBLE your money. Simulated gambling. Should be taken down or the age restriction set so children don't spend money",1,2020-09-01 00:03:05
"I have played the game for three years now, and I loved it, but every new update is worse than the last. It's becoming more and more pay to win, and after the latest update replaced the chests with lootboxes and removed season shop, the best feature they've introduced in recent years, I've stopped playing.

My original rating of 4 stars still holds true if you don't mind paying 4.99 a month. I am contemplating quiting this game after playing it from launch due to the money grab that is the season pass. If it was just more free stuff for the pass then maybe I could deal with it but.... when you don't give free to play players quality of life perks like queing up chests it's just insulting. Btw I have spent plenty of money in the past supporting this game and bought 2 months of the pass. No more.,2,2019-10-18 01:21:03
Pay to win and the fact that rewards have been lessen such as gems or the hidden nerf to wild cards in chest. Then the worth of common and rare cards conversion to elite wild card gets nerfed is a joke. Same still stands. Disgusting game from greedy devs.,1,2025-12-03 03:05:09
everyone who rates 1 star has a skill issue this game is great and I've been playing for around 9 years completely free. People the pay money for upgrades dont gain that much of an advantage as long as you know to actually play the game well and anyone who say otherwise just cant comit to playing a dun game cus they suck. by far the best mobile game.,5,2025-10-20 08:39:33

"If you like pay to win, completely unbalanced games, then this is for you. When you have to go against someone who spent $200 on the game and has a clear advantage over you, it just makes the game so fun. To improve the gameplay, they have taken all of the overpowered cards, and buffed them! It used to be such a good game and now it's such a bad experience. I like the devs but they have to know how terrible they're making the game.",2,2022-07-10 01:08:19

I had all of the cards which were taken, I was at challenger, I was in a great clan, and even though I tried logging in with Supercell ID, Facebook, Google play, I never got my progress in. A huge waste of more than 100 hours spent on this game.",2,2020-07-03 12:33:37

"Genuinely this game is really bad, its the most pay to win game possible to make. And that's horrible for a game that acts like it's competitive. Most matches the level of your cards are the deciding factor if you win or not. And even then there's just to much annoying gameplay mechanics, and just annoying characters overall. And I'm not even gonna lie, I'm addicted to this s'itty ahh game, if I don't play it, I feel like playing it. It's an absolute dopamine trap. I wish I could give it 0 stars",1,2024-11-20 07:12:35

This is a genuinely good game that has been eroded down into a pay-to-win shell of itself.,2,2025-11-29 00:43:41
It was fun for a while but then they added broken cards and cant balance anything people have complained about it for a while but they dont do anything about it it's just not fun I've been playing for around 5 years 2 on a old account 3 on my current one and they just changed the game too much and made it pay to win. I do not recommend if you dont plan and paying money for in game items or want to have fun.,2,2022-07-29 05:21:30
"The game itself and the graphics are awesome as all your games, but there is a huge thing called ""p2w"" in this game.

What I meant is make a better system for all battles",3,2019-12-17 08:24:15
"Game is fantastic in theory, but if you don't have money to spend don't waste your time. You are put up against people who have higher and better cards than you would have if you play without purchasing. Level 12 tower with maxed out cards vs level 11 makes the game very frustrating.

"Unbelievable that so much can be unlocked with money with so little unlocked from just playing the game. As of writing this review, and not including the purchase options for gems, there are ads to spend a potential 190 dollars to increase card levels, troop unlocks, and gold. 190 dollars to just buy your way into leveling everything up and unlocking the newest things.

Never maxing out your cards because they're always cash-grabbing with new levels and now the pay-to-own elites( no one can convince me otherwise).

"The gameplay is alright, but it's stunted from microtransactions. Only 4 chest slots with 3 hour timers to unlock each one, only unlock one at a time. The gameplay is roughly 5 minutes each, so i play for 5 minutes, then wait 3-12 hours for a chest to unlock to get another slot. Rinse repeat. The gameplay itself is decent, but its less tactics, and more just having the higher number, which you can get by spending money. There's nothing else on here to keep me wanting to come back",1,2023-10-19 22:37:44
"As far as Graphics, Amount of Gameplay Functions such as Quests and just things to do in general, everything is fine. The only problem I have been seeing is that you are not Equally matched against others with the same Card Deck Quality and possible options available to them vs what u may have since you haven't either been playing as long or don't Pay to Win. Also there should be some sort of system in place that accounts for people who just Pay To Win Vs others like myself that don't buy anything to help increase the difficulty, play factor and longevity of the game. The Developers could add a system that acknowledges whether or not someone has Purchased items and if so, phase them into there own Group which only allows them to be Matched against others who have been phased into that group from Purchasing Items as well. Then for the individuals who are in the Non-Purchased Items Group, if they would like to possibly increase there difficulty in a way so to speak, they could have an option to turn On or Off which would allow them to be Matched with individuals in the Purchased Items Group. With all that said, this post probably won't be seen by anyone but it does bring up some good Characteristics that would help Current and Future Games along with all of it being plausible and easy to emplement. Thank U All for your time and Keep Gaming!!!!",4,2018-11-23 18:26:44
"I don't understand why there is a ranked option where you are limited by the level of your cards. It destroys competitive integrity because it really doesn't matter after a while if you just don't have high level cards.

"First of all, this is a Pay to Win game, more money you spend more you can do, chest doesn't reward the time you spend on the game, the opponents are to high or to low, almost imposible to compete agaist your kings' lvl, you can play over a year and you will never get a full deck available, the theme of the game is pretty good, but it forces you to spend your money if you wanted to be a good player. Not recommended, sorry!",1,2023-07-27 11:04:51
"This is a fun free to play game, it is strategic and requires abit of thinking, I like the style of the game but I'd like the developers to make the elixers produce abit faster because I'm kind of struggling to get units out",5,2025-10-18 01:14:41
"It's the most pay to win game ever. It used to be better but now i get unfair matchups and it's impossible to win.

I would change my rating if it was more free to play friendly but until then my rating is not changing from 2 star. Thanks for reading if u made it this far!",2,2025-03-27 07:36:52

The shop has at least 7 to 8 offers that give you a huge advantage where you can flat out buy a full evolution for cheap.While you are at it, buy champion cards which in my arena at 3400 you can't even unlock them until 5500.",2,2024-10-22 16:04:07

"Too many barriers between casual and paying players. Uninstalled after 8 years. Game has always been at least some level of fun for me until they recently added another level + unfair pay-to-win evo's. Not even being maxed nowadays makes this game fun; who knows if they'll just add another level that you have to grind out for the *chance* of balanced fight. I'm pretty decent at the game, but seeing megaknight, firecracker and balloon+freeze in 95% of your games is just boring and frustrating.",1,2024-04-03 05:10:17
worst pay to play game on the market im filling out a lawsuit against you played the same boring game for 9 years so people can pay money and have maxed out troops every time I play its pathetic how about worry about fixing the game and have more exciting wars a ranking system anything but more troops so you can make more money and the game worse owner should be forced to sell to someone who cares about the game not stealing more money from kids so pathetic owner should be sued for millions,1,2025-12-30 23:36:57

"I used to love the og clash royale. Installed this app after a long time to see how much it would have changed. Not going to lie, I expected it to be more fun but it's just the opposite. This game has just become a pay to win game and one of the worst. I legit uninstalled it 1 week later. Once you get to Arena 17 and above it's game over for you if you are a Free to play player. The game has become absurd since the release of the Evolution cards and adding Dagger Princess was a really bad idea..",1,2024-06-04 14:00:26
"Supercell's games are what all mobile games should strive for. There are no ads, and the gameplay is advanced. The higher up you go in trophies the harder it gets, and once it gets to a certain point you have to progress your cards more than your actual gameplay. The matchmaking isn't ""rigged"", but they do have bots in the early stages, and because you might end up climbing so fast you'll get queued up against high level players.

"Overall a great well done app. The problem is they manipulate the game play trying to get you frustrated and spend money. It's not noticeable at first, but if you play on multiple accounts you really begin to see it. Whenever you are playing a battle that counts for something, they will pair you against others by stronger then yourself. If the battle isn't really worth anything they will pair you equally. If they would stop controlling everything so much it would be the best out there. 🙁",2,2019-12-13 05:58:08
"2025 Update: I should have updated this a while ago. THE GOOD: Adding evolutuons to certain cards is ibteresying. Different gameplay modes allow you to play how you want. 2v2 is back! THE TERRIBLE: Gone are the treasure chests that would give you many rewards. Now, it is replaced with boxes that you have to tab several times to open and giving you less rewards in the end. This game was play to win, now it's pay to play at all. Clan War with boats still sucks,",2,2025-04-01 18:47:22
"I'm changing my review to a 1 star because Chests have been removed, only the 3 daily lucky drops remain (which was added to supplement the slow ftp progress). The battlepass has been made less valuable especially on the ftp side, and items such as the Evo shards are being even more expensive (this isn't the first time, evos used to also come with a few wild cards, which was also removed a while ago). They now go for 5.99 USD When they used to be 3.99 USD. Greed has overtaken this game.",1,2025-04-01 04:43:33

I've been playing this game for over two years and they have absolutely butchered this game with the latest update. The new clan battle is pretty awful and has cool down times that make it near impossible for casual clans to complete. Its obvious that this change was made in an attempt to force users to have to spend money to upgrade troops that they otherwise wouldn't use. Also there is clearly some major server issues as this game freezes frequently during battle I'm close to calling it quits,1,2020-09-27 01:30:22

"The game is fine, but matchmaking at higher ranks sucks. Instead of matching you by tower and card levels, it will match you based on trophies, which means you will be playing against people who you have no chance against due to the immense level gap. This system is in place to incentivize you to spend money to level up your cards so you can be the one who wrecks everybody else. If you dont pay to win, you will need to spend ridiculous amounts of time to each the higher levels. Kind of scummy:(",1,2020-05-12 11:01:23
"Crazy game! My class plays it and we're having so much fun in the clan war and friendly 1v1s, also the game is fun and strategic unlike clash of clans where it's about patience and brawl stars which is too kiddish and not really skilled however there could be updates that up the game like adding upgrade all troops button instead of spamming and upgrade fully using all extra cards like you have firecracker cards that could level 3 times Ù do immediately also nerf miner and mega knight!

The new hero cards, wizard and ice golem, are both locked behind a paywall for the entire season, and new lvl 16 cards are too strong for any lower lvl card to counter.

"Entertaining. Addicting. Trash. 3 words to sum this game up. Make no mistake - while there's definitely an element of skill/good timing involved, it's very much a pay-to-win game. When you get to a certain level, Supercell's algorithms will match you w/someone in a well-connected online ""clan,"" or who's a CC player. Meaning your opponents will often be at a higher level (or sometimes a lower level) with maxed out cards all higher than yours. It becomes a, ""War of Attrition."" Painful.",3,2024-12-08 04:37:20

Usually they would reset this monthly.",1,2023-04-04 00:29:03
"The general idea of the game is good, other than that it's SO bad, you have to either pay them so much to level up your cards and king tower, or grind for years, and unless you reached the max level it's basically pay-to-win, you'll reach a certain point and you won't be able to win just because everyone has higher level cards, and even if you max out, it's mostly based on luck, and who got the better match up, and it gives a clear advantage to passive play styles which makes it not fun at all.",2,2021-10-03 21:29:15
"It used to be 100% skill based game. But now this game has become pay to win. You can pay and become stronger than your opponents by using evolved cards.

If they want to change their deck after that, which is a very common thing, they have to wait for another year.

one star Becoz it becomes pay to win now they didn't let free to play players get exclusive emotess if they give they remove the exclusiveness from emotes and they now did the worst update about merge tactics which many players don't like and most of the main thing is they change leagues to ranked a free to play person need 15000 tropies to unlock ranked it means normal person can't enjoy that gameplay due to their scam,1,2025-08-21 23:40:26
8 years of this game still going strong. multiple accounts this game has had its ups and downs just like any other but overall i love it. But i live in NYC and its not common to find real people that play it and then they cat win against me so thats lame but 10/10,5,2025-08-23 11:02:39
Ive had my account since 2016. Nd i gotta say this is awful now. really just a cashgrab. ive never seen a game so dependent on spending money. i remember when this game too some form of strategy. now yu jus get bullied if yu dont spend money. yu cant compete unless yu have money to spend or make this game yur entire life.,1,2025-10-23 06:58:59

Literally can't play a match without my opponent having every counter to my deck. This games doesn't even deserve one star.

Great game but I tried to also log in to Clash of clans using my supercell I'd and it logged me out of Clash Royal. every time I try to log in it says to put in my email so it can send me a code to verify that is me.

"Is Clash Royale management hiring? I would love to tell my workers make the game so much pay to win that people have to spend money and I could just sit back recline on my chair and just have the money roll in. It forces you to level up your cards, if you don't have them to spend money to get more cards. One of the most top scamming games in the store still after 5 years. You feel good beating bots, then going against real people with higher cards it puts you in a spot to not progress. TRASH!",1,2025-09-20 12:49:22
"downloaded Clash Royale thinking it would be a fun little strategy game. What I actually downloaded was a rage simulator cleverly disguised as entertainment. Every match starts off fine — I drop a Knight, they drop a Knight — but five seconds later I’m watching my towers crumble under a level 15 Mega Knight while my poor Level 11 cards are out there doing moral support at best. Let’s talk about the matchmaking system, shall we? It’s like the game sees I’m having a good day and decides, “Nope,",1,2025-10-25 09:34:49

evo mega knight proves just how brainless these devs are. they take an already heavily used powerful card. and they make it do insane knock back and damage. so either you run the card in your deck or you cater to counter it. in the last 9 games I played 6 of them had that card. 2 had the evo version. Its a blight on this game. and quickly reminds me why I stopped playing this garbage.,1,2025-08-26 09:36:24

The algorithm has become more irritating as it will match you with opponents (in 2-3 streaks) that have 70-80% identical/similar decks that you have lost to previously, your Kryptonite.

so over the long years I have played this it hurts. you cant enjoy the game truly. it's pay to win for those who haven't spent all they life grinding to max but that is even payed because it's either you never have enough resources or cards to ever upgrade or you never win because people spent money to max out. what makes it worse is they won't ever fix it because all they want is money. a shame.,1,2025-09-22 08:55:30
"Don't play this, every update the game becomes more pay to win, they removed most of the few ways F2P players had to compete against P2W players (e.g season shop deletion), and they keep them on leash by talking about an update which never came.

Thus without talking about evolutions, that are OP on release and nerfed when a new is released, to force players to buy them.",1,2025-11-08 21:00:39
pay to win and you can only win if you have bought the latest pass where you can max out so many things to high lvls going against low lvl ppl so you can win each game but it is a very 'fair and balanced' game when only being to win if you have bought things in-game otherwise you get destroyed by Evo furnace in arena 5 with evo wizard pushing next to furnace,1,2025-09-19 04:14:00

"Nerf MegaKnight. There is clear evidence of how unbalanced both his base and Evo cards are. Every single match is another megaknight spam. He does too much. He needs to lose something. The splash on regular hits, or less health. He is tanking better than most tanks, damaging more than any tank but Pekka, and splashing the only units that could deal with him. The entire game wouldn't be spamming him if he wasn't busted. His evo is ridiculously broken but that is a whole other can of worms.",1,2025-09-03 19:27:51

Why is there a cancel button when you Can't even cancel the match 99% of the time? And the matchmaking is broken getting queued up with someone from higher elo rather than someone with the same Crown as mine. Been playing for around 3 months and the problem still persues.

this games used to be awsome and the changes they did were awsome but its just a pay to win game now and its stupid so unless you plan on spending your paycheck you'll just be stuck at an arena forever wining a game then lossing a game at least make it so you lose onky like 10 or 15 trophies if you loose by one tower or in overtime with a 10 hp digfrence you give theese cards op evolutions and the only way to get em is emptying out your pockets,1,2025-09-24 21:19:27

this balancing makes me go crazy these meta crutches on trophy road are hell every * with an iq of 4 spams stuff which cant be countered with any possible deck combination i could do with my cards including levels and firecracker always chips the tower and the hogrider is just so fast just 1 level difference is such a big problem not to mention mks useless aoe hits on the melee (not jump) then the PRINCE range (and 12x more that but i only got 500 letters i would do the balancing so much better),1,2025-09-24 04:22:51

This game was good at one point. Supercell has continued to disappoint during recent updates more pay 2 win than the game has every been. Ever since the game re-gained popularity all the developers care about is money. Fix your matchmaking aswell its tragic,1,2025-09-27 21:19:33

"Supercell has become irreparably greedy. 75 percent of my losses are because my opponent has one or more EVO cards.

Bug fixes and improvements? Get your head out of the dirt and take your eyes off of mid ladder or high ladder cause low ladder players are suffering. Overlevelled cards are not a problem in higher arenas but in the starter arenas anyone who has the good cards can overpower anyone with one level lower. It makes a huge difference. But that is not the main problem. The problem is that your system of matchmaking does not work. I would explain but this review would be too long.,1,2025-11-11 15:29:01
the game has a huge pay to win problem. For people playing this game without using money will be incredibly hard. Especially if you are a more casual player,2,2025-10-19 21:46:34

if I could give this game a zero I would. the creator of this game is a going to hell because the algorithm when u lose 6 times in a row stills puts u against the best player in the world and if u win just once it will also pu u against the best player ever. this game is just terrible,1,2025-09-29 08:16:56

Unfair matchmaking and no dev help whatsoever because it's pay to win and they rather have money than a stable community with fairness. Being matched with players at tower and card levels beyond you because they'd rather match you based on time than actually level and stats.,1,2025-09-17 08:56:38

it is very fun personally I am on Chromebook it is kinda hard but I am glad that it is the only thing I don't like is sometimes the matchmaking puts me with like a pro or something and its just not fair sometimes but overall it is very fun!,4,2025-10-15 05:54:54
this game is so pay to win it's not even funny. It starts alright but once you get to mid ladder it hell. You suck at the game? That's fine give us 40$ to unlock the new evo card and other 50$ for the new card that's so game breaking its just an insta win. if you dont hand over your entire wallet youre not having in this game,1,2025-09-17 23:50:00

The matchmaking I've faced so far is really unfair due to the enemy somehow having a card from arena 10(golem) and 14(executioner) and i believe its because of the pay 2 win system in the game It's really rare to face a opponent with the same card level equal to mine,1,2025-09-12 09:05:03

you guys are sick you don't care if anyone enjoys the game or not you need to restrict certain tower levels to specific arenas because you reward players that spend a lot of money with low level players to maul over maxed players as opposers below 10k trophies is the most frustrating thing ever because skill does not matter if your opponent can simply out muscle you🙂,1,2025-09-26 20:49:28

my expirence was overall good just when you get to anout 7 to 10 k trphies you need to spend alot of money to win and most of people my age dont have money cause we cant get a job so i think they should do free evolutions some times so players in higher arenas will get better and less people will quit because and give cards out all though i know they need to make enough money but there revenew is enough to pay bills soo its a three star because the game is to pay to win overall great game,3,2025-10-21 13:54:17

as a 10000 player with 5 years experience with clash i can say it s a very amusing game as it's a more complicated version of chess as every card u place has unique interactions and it's really amusing and highly addictive i used to smoke while playing clash i quit smoking but i couldnt quit clash but as a f2p player I suffered a lot through my jounery as many cards are almost impossible to have unless u gave away ur money like some champions. plz clash make elite wild cards easier to obtain ty.,4,2025-11-09 19:12:18

i like the game overall and it is very enjoyable but alot of us and myself have noticed certain players with higher level cards or cards that are from higher arenas we are not in they take advantage of players who have lower lv. cards you need to fix this e.g if they are at the bottom of the arena and their crowns are at the lowest of the arena they should be stuck their until they progress higher pls fix this 🙏,3,2025-09-03 03:35:48

"the devs really love making pekka the last card in my 4.6 deck when my opponent decides to go golem at the bridge 10 secs into the game. Do something about the first 4 cards that you get because in mid ladder you get lunatics who play 10 elexir worth of cards at the bridge 10 secs into the game and then if i dont have my executioner or pekka in hand i have simply lost the game. Also evolutions, mega knight and now vines have ruined a game that was once my favorite.",1,2025-09-05 14:49:48

it's a good game but when you pass 1000 trophies it's basically impossible to win because the game allows for people to infinitely spam many characters at once due to the 2x 3x and so on so I would recommend to remove losing trophies if you lose,3,2025-11-18 09:01:54
this is a fun game but the logistics of it are way off I'm using one of the strongest characters and it got took out by a tier two ghost while I had a tier three pekka it's just the fact the the power scaling if way off,3,2025-09-14 01:36:25

the game is so bad that people have some people have infinite elipsir and to many bugs that that sometimes the game kicks me out of the game also the only card that is not balanced well is the golem 400 at poins at his max level 14 to 15 when other cards makes more than 500 to 1000 that ridiculos,1,2025-10-19 14:40:03

Its a great game but still problem with matchmaking as it sets free to pay players with pay to win players which is kinda unfair because we have low level cards and they have high level cards.

"You always could at least enjoy casually playing CR with friends. Also, its competitive game modes, while frustrating due to borken mechanics put in place to encourage spending, were somewhat enticing.

With my level 10 and 11 cards I managed to reach 7200 trophies in just one month, but now it won’t let me climb further because it keeps giving me much stronger opponents.

"they ruined it , specially the evo cards you. ant defeat it it's too powerful they even gave the stupid megaknight a evo as if it wasn't terrible enough as a legendary card and with they also added evo card s as separate cards i.e you can have two versions of same card at the same time yup you read right two versions of same cards at same time!! but the worst part is that to get evo shard you have to spend soooo much MONEY and it's impossible to win as a FREE TO PLAY PLAYER",1,2025-09-30 06:37:38

Back after a year or so. Mann this game is so much worse than before. Turned more to pay to win. Since getting shards is very difficult otherwise. Interface si laggy and bugged. Terrible experience,1,2025-11-11 16:39:56

Terrible experience for free to play players. The amount of pay to winners are ridiculous and the updates are barley worth the wait. its far passed its glory days and now is a money grab from supercell wich is expected from them.,2,2025-11-15 06:31:03

Anyone esle feel like your playing the against the same deck over and over like thats the only one you can lose against they match you up to lose it feels like. They put so many new players but its always same,1,2025-10-15 10:42:54
The game is good but sometimes even though my internet is in excellent condition the game starts lagging everything works except the game fix this !!!! really mad about this glitch,1,2025-10-11 12:37:54
Horrible game. It is so pay to win. went against 5 people who had inferno dragon in a row in an arena before the inferno dragon is unlocked. They need to remove the use of cards before their respective arena. They also have a balancing issue that can usually be turned over to your favor by paying enough.,2,2025-10-08 07:41:51
"it became a pay to win game, almost pay to win. buy offers or you lose! my towers are level 10, my cards are 10 and all of my opps are level 13 with level 14 evo cards!!!!!! and mega knight evo is almost cheat, no way to defeat it. hate you supercell",1,2025-11-17 13:55:26
perfect game it's top not even debate but it's so op that they are adding skeleton witch or something like that it's so op you can't defend yourself if you don't have something explosion card and one more thing also there peka is not op against skeleton army or goblin gang because with one swing he can kill only one creators you have to do more something like with one swing he will kill 3 or 4 creature,5,2025-09-29 20:44:58
final update after a short break. absolutely impossible unless you spend $$$. cannot even compete unless you spend. not just a little but spend a mint! barely any few match ups. don't waste time or money. just not worth it anymore.,1,2025-10-11 02:15:59

Elixer collected should be removed from the game.Players have been farming elixer and getting three musketeers with it and it's hard to defend completely even while 1v1 and 2v2.Elixer collected allow user to farm wins and make players more unlikely to play this game,1,2025-11-11 07:40:26
the game is cool but the matchmaking is dogshit i personally am arena 15 on new account an always get guys with at least 1 tower level above me and it sucks that i only get overleveled opponents it was relaxing but rn far too sweaty so sorry only to stars i will give more if you please would work on the matchmaking thanks,2,2025-10-04 12:51:35
"been playing the game for almost 10 yrs, used to be a creator named KFC, that's still my user. Although it is p2w, you need to progress by building up your skills and tactics, not by buying OP cards and playing like that.",5,2025-11-18 01:31:24

amazing game but there are some balancing issues and I think it would be cool if they permanently had game modes such as all evolutions. the four card game mode was fun as well so those permanently would be fun also BUFF MINER,4,2025-09-09 09:17:06

"Clash Royale, once celebrated for its strategic depth, is now widely criticized for devolving into a pay-to-win grind that prioritizes aggressive monetization over fair gameplay. The introduction of new features like Level 15, Evolutions, and increasingly expensive Pass Royale tiers has significantly widened the gap between free-to-play users and paying players. This is exacerbated by a rigged matchmaking system that frequently pairs players against perfect counter-decks or over leveled decks",1,2025-08-28 04:11:34

"I update my review since 2021 clash royale is good so far but it still needs to go along way, we need clans war 3.0 with more ways to get chest and lucky drops in the clan also bring more modes to the clan wars instead of changing game modes on war days let's select which ever game mode we want. Duel is outdated rework it also more gold more points. Also give us more ways to get trade tokens and elite cards. If it can be settled the I'll rate 5 Star please Supercell listen to the community",3,2025-09-20 21:56:07
"Supercell clan functionality continues to absolutely disappoint, while heavily relying on external sources to recruit, communicate with, and review clan stats. The clans are also limited by an extremely dysfunctional clan management system that only has two ""roles"" which go from the Elder's ""you can invite new members"" to suddenly having Co-Leaders with the ability to fully control all functions of the clan similar to the actual Leader role (only excluding the ability to demote other Co-Leaders)",2,2025-10-05 17:43:44

Is a great game for people who play every day like me and it has great adventure through the arenas that include many varieties of card. What is cool is their are clan wars and ther is evolutions that can enhance gameplay and fun.,5,2025-10-20 15:50:34

after sometime it's not just pay to win. it's dump all your money to win. or get lucky and join a clan where everyone else pays to win. you see a level 13 player with only level 15 troops. Fairer gameplay in a casino app,1,2025-10-19 00:01:18
Its a really fun game I takes strategy and hard thinking some parts of this game are annoying like the mid ladder menaces and the mega nights and boss bandits the prince and more but it's all around a really fun game. # Nerf MIner,5,2025-10-01 06:01:07
Don't play this game. It's totally a payment to win game now. It was better before evolution. Evolution 🧬 made the more worse. those who pay more have more shards quickly. Rigged Match Making also. don't download it.,1,2025-09-12 03:41:10
"I'm glad that 2v2s are back. However, the game is still p2w. Also, it would be glad if they made more chest events since gaining chests from battles are no longer here, making it hard to receive more cards for leveling up.",4,2025-10-15 15:36:13

this is a really good game but there's some stuff about it. this game is p2w like literally and sometimes when I'm in a battle it's like supercell is watching me and puts me up with hard counters or just a mega knight deck please separate f2p players and p2w players in this game. and plzzz bring back season shop. thanks,5,2025-10-10 13:50:44

great game for quick bursts of fun. would be even better if you could at least discard chests to make room for that special one... 2025 update: bots galore. have to recommend you skip this game as you will be playing against bots for most of the time.,5,2025-10-29 16:37:50

been playing for ages I don't know if they check this stuff but .. changing tower troops is impossible in clan wars. is this on purpose or can u fix it in the next patch been playing this game for 9 years. one of my fav games can u please fix the clan wars tower troops thingy I'm not able to change it,5,2025-10-04 12:11:26
It's hard for newbie's like me you always get an unfair fight so it's hard to rank up when your deck levels are low cause you can't really win against someone who have better decks level and it can wipe out your entire army,1,2025-10-16 19:31:53

the game is so paid to win but that's not the worst part the worst part is that if U don't have good WiFi Ur basically screwed cause the minute Ur WiFi drops even a tiny bit the game lags so bad and then speeds up to catch up with Ur opponent and by the time the lag is gone Ur towers r gone and Ur king is left on half health,1,2025-09-11 23:31:24

Almost every update makes the game worse. Champions were ruined by removing their ability to speed up cycles. Pass Royale was ruined by removing its Book of Books and doubling its price. High elixir push decks are constantly punished by devs in favor of low elixir cycle. New cards are made intentionally OP then nerfed to force players to buy them to compete. Firecracker exists.

Not good for beginners. Heroes unlocked on higher arena ae played on lower arena. Hard to level up to be par with others tower and units level. Been facing lvl 12 towers when I am only lvl 10.,1,2025-09-13 11:31:30

"Ppl ask me why I love this game so much it's because it's fun, like supercell you made the best game tho, it's heavily advised if you have a evo credit card to play pay to win, this game is easy at first until higher areans even when they are using mega gay, boss bandit, and pekka lvl 13 stuff and it gets hard I wanted to quit so many times.

the game is in unstable position new evos are too op or just sucks. kinda game of skill or just a money grab recommend to start playing it until you dislike it or start raging badly for your own safety I suggest to quit the game.,3,2025-11-13 02:02:23
played this game for years and last couple updates it won't load gets to 75 % and says updating. have used wifi and tried uninstalling and reinstalled and same issue.,1,2025-08-31 21:19:57

Amazing Game with little to no ads but my only issue is that there are a lot of p2w features and the game can get sweaty later on but overall a blast to play,4,2025-11-03 02:11:34
"this game is ruining my gameplay by making me fight bots that is just ruining my trophies and on top of that, this game is very rigged with the win to lose ratio a 50/50 so if u win u will definitely be losing afterwards",1,2025-09-06 03:36:03
I highly recommend this game but the server is constantly crashing and it suck When am in the middle of rank match but I tolerate it what I don't tolerate is sweaty player like there on there last game in championship.,5,2025-11-02 19:40:20

honestly amazing one you know how to play and easy to learn harder to master it would be 5stars but they are adding to many useless Evo cards in desperation but still a great game probably the best Supercell games ever,4,2025-09-07 21:49:32
9 years of playing and their updates still keep crashing the game mid-match. Supercell needs to upgrade the infrastructure instead of adding more content.,2,2025-11-10 06:27:07
I started this game back in 2016 and im surprised how bad its gotten I would even go to say this is worst than the downfall of fortnite😭 all this game is now is pay too win and it isn't even enjoyable anymore n the fact they also got rid of chest is absurd fix your game supercell.,1,2025-10-27 01:05:37
"Great addictive game. But opening chests (mainly if you are on the top of the arenas and have every single card) can be pain... it would be great if developers add some ""collect them all button"", or ""collect previous rewards""",5,2025-11-03 18:07:00

"One thing that is always unfair and never going to be fixed is that the server will always match me up with SOMEONE that have a card that I DON'T HAVE. they have miner, then they have princess when I have none of that. Skill issue? More like server issue.",5,2025-09-29 19:52:57
HORRIBLE matchmaking for free to play players. Its impossible to progress due to facing opponents several levels higher with max cards. Slow developwrs in the brain.,1,2025-10-08 07:04:43
I have three words pay to win. That's all that the game has become nowadays I'm playing ppl with boss bandit at 2000 trophies. Like what the heck why do you need to spend money? If you don't fix this imma quit the game.,1,2025-09-23 02:28:16
"Money runs the game. If you don’t have it, don’t waste your time. It’s not about skill — it’s about who can afford the best tools. They preach fair play, but in the end, it’s all about who’s got the most to spend.",1,2025-11-05 03:05:42
I personally love this game and have been playing for a couple years and it's relaxing/competitive game that can be frustrating but mostly due to p2w players but otherwise awesome 👌,5,2025-09-18 08:10:28
Yet another one of Supercell's disappointing cash grabs. One of the worst games I've ever played. Wouldn't recommend this to anyone if I cared about them.,1,2025-10-04 05:26:15
the match making is terrible and you guys have no shame no matter how bad the reviews are the time it takes for your elixer to load is different once the game want u to win ut loads faster once it wants u to lose it loads slower why cant u make it fair ?? and pair your opponents with similar levels,1,2025-09-04 16:28:00
This game is rigged and full of bots. play it to have fun but don't purchase anything you will lose tons of money and still end up frustrated due to unfair matchmaking and bots defeating you so easily. if you have doubts on my take play and observe.,5,2025-09-09 04:10:07
The game is completely pay to win. The developers are money hungry and don't care for the community at all. Don't bother playing if you're not willing to spend 50$ or more to keep up with the people it sets you up against.,1,2025-11-03 09:47:21
This game sucks it's paid to win have to constantly buy gold to upgrade troops of how much they cost. constantly microtransactions.,1,2025-09-28 07:57:21
its honestly a very fun and entertaining game if your board or just wanna have fun. its competitive and its really great. although once your at arena 4 or above its hard to put the game down😊. I highly recommend this game.,5,2025-11-14 19:00:19
"worst game ever, the entire game is just based on luck, and card levels, my opponents always have higher level towers and cards and I'm here with level 11 cards. DONT DOWNLOAD IT",1,2025-10-28 15:05:00
"p2w, bad dev teams, unbalanced cards, everyone knows. but I could get behind all of this if they didnt have the feature of always somehow finding a hard counter to your deck. even if it is home made it will experiment with what you can and cant defend and put you against people that have those cards. the matchmaking should be random, not based on your deck. this is such so infuriating going against the same cards like megaknight every match. fix your game supercell",1,2025-10-31 12:52:33
it's a very fine game when you are bored but they need to fix the friends so you can add them and play even without a supercell I'd overall it's a good game,5,2025-09-12 09:01:45
game is scammy great concept - but let's be real the game has been around since 2016.. died off and came back...because of youtubers.. they didn't learn their lesson the 1st time.,3,2025-09-29 13:17:42

the game was one of my favourite games . but one day when I opened the game it just kicked me out and wanted me to start over and I was at 5k trophies,2,2025-11-03 23:44:53
Wow such a good game would be a shame if they added a mega knight with splash damage or a giant with electricity on its back. And a real shame if both these cards could counter swarm and everyone used it.,1,2025-09-03 21:43:18

"this is one of the most pay to win games ever, but aside that it's actually really good just don't rage quit bc its not that deep i would really recommend it to people who like games like bloons td it's similar but In my opinion clash is better",4,2025-10-30 06:01:53
the game is fun for a while but then you just make little kids cry like you said in your videos and its just to addicting you got me playing it for 59 days straight im deleting this is hate it so much now,1,2025-08-28 13:49:34
This game is now worse than any EA games combined with a Very toxic players and pay to win BS if you like spending money for a stupid cheat in a mobile game then this is what I recommend for you. Again the worst mobile game ever.,1,2025-09-24 05:41:41

It may be free but you better hope you have an evo credit card or you wont keep up. this game is really good if you love getting so mad to the point the device your playing on might not see tomorrow.,5,2025-09-30 07:27:39
fun to play strategic game. only downside is you can cheat by paying for upgrades....which is what many people do. however you can still advance and play competitively without spending anything.,4,2025-10-18 01:14:48

It's defeated my entire motivation for completion...I'm not just annoyed, I'm actually really pissed off. Go eff yourselves Supercell, seriously.",1,2023-08-13 22:04:34

I am 8k but now it is not plays it Is evos left right n centre it Is a bit crazy. overall great game.,5,2025-09-10 15:01:08

"I hold a special place for this game in my heart due to the obtainable cards and the grind to push for higher arenas (despite me getting hard stuck in arena 20 for a week).

But, not just any Evo's in particular I'm talking about the Evo credit card. A quick simple transaction to help me get out of my arena.Ty Supercell ❤️ I love the latest update",5,2025-09-10 20:15:10

definitely pay to win we have the same stats 28 wins 28 3 star wins strategy alone i am actually winning but the problem is my opponent cards are too high it even had an evolution card at low levels thats what you are paying for you get vip treatment since its an old game from 2016 i guess its ok to ruin it a bit and switch strategy and make it p2w in order for the company to make more money from an old game,1,2025-08-26 14:36:03

A useless game lower rank gets higher rank and we need to spend money to tackle them .........waste of time.... totally waste of time..........as soon as u gonna reach on top they will give u players with max card .........cheap tricks,1,2025-10-17 06:16:45
"stupid pay to win game that no longer takes skill to play and everyone on it plus the devs are all brain dead, anyone who says this game is still good or fun is lying through their teeth or brain rotted, took all the fun out of how the game original was",1,2025-10-03 23:42:38
so pay to win can't do anything after 9500 trophies every deck is the monthly new meta deck that i can't play cause I am free to play but all the others can and when it's not a meta deck it's a hard counter.,1,2025-09-23 22:36:58
oct. 3rdish 2025 and I want to play but it crashes every time I launch it. I can't seenw whats new or battle or anything. I see other people playing it but I can't on Android. please fix this.,2,2025-10-11 18:48:41
Game is really good like most supercell games but progression takes a long time and you need to get bad opponents to win easily. Game takes skill and smarts,4,2025-09-16 01:14:45
"this game is highly dependent on money (pay to win) i am free to play arena 22 player the only reason why i start losing bc i am facing more pay to win players, i dont recommend playing this game if u are not wanting to spend 100-500 dollars on this game",1,2025-09-28 21:46:15

clash royal is a very fun game to be played especially on a mobile without even need of rotating the screen and also got fun combat in matches with lots of players to attack.,5,2025-08-24 01:38:58
love that game so much I've been playing for 6 7 years and I've grinded as a f2p all the way to 15000 trophies and I still dont have a maxed out deck while the pay to wins have had maxed decks since the beginning my recommendation is that you boost the free pass with better rewards,5,2025-08-25 17:59:10
worst game I've ever played made me depressed I wanna kill myself 1000 times over and over because of how deppresing this game has made me worst decision of my life would not recommend. fun some of the time.,1,2025-10-17 00:37:10

I rated a 3 because when i play i always lose it because of the mega knight he to op im stuck at arena 11 plus the elite barbarians take so many engy stuff also if your an og the you got amazing cards but if your new you have not good cards its because of the update change the cards in to different arenas its just not fair plus my old account had so many legendarys but now i lost it its just so frustrating.,5,2025-10-15 15:42:07

Rip Off. anytime your about to reach an achievement they set u back nout 7 matches just so that you can grind back up and loose 5 more in roll. it never fails. and how are we supposed to Dfeat cards we don't even have?? SuperCell should be changed to SeperHell!!!,2,2025-09-18 19:00:49

Pretty great game. Requires a lot of skill and thought but really fun tbh. Everyone who gives this game a bad review needs to cope.,5,2025-08-31 07:26:30
Where are the trade tokens and magic coins??? Everything for progression is being silently removed or locked behind a paywall and replaced with useless card boost potions and banners. The end of ranked mode and little to no events. Don't think players are oblivious to your greedy tactics making clash yet another pay to win scam. Keep going so you can ruin the popularity boost clash has been seeing recently and end up in the graveyard of games next to angry birds.,1,2025-10-23 23:52:45

being a f2p is very annoying I'm at seasonal arena 2 all the people that I face have all the meta decks fully maxed out so they have so a big advantage over you and the way they cut the season pass I. half makes it 10x harder to level up your cards the one thing that I find good is the 2v2 that's really it once I hit ultimate champion I'm quitting unless they can fix there game and stop making the game so pay to win,2,2025-09-18 10:15:09

I guess they weren't making enough money before. Very sad. This will probably kill my clan and my reason to play. 7 year badge on my account. Thanks I guess.",1,2023-04-04 01:50:03
"It was a fun game, but with every update it get harder and harder to play for free and still progress. With the newest update comming out, they will remove a lot from the free seasons pass, things like the super wild champion chest, champions are hard to get in general and when they remove this chest from the free pass, it will make it almost impossible.",2,2023-04-02 19:14:12

"Excellent game. Well made, never gets tiring or repetitive. Updates constantly to keep it fresh.",5,2025-11-25 07:28:50
this game is fun you should add a evo rocket and it does splash damage when it lands it spreads,5,2025-12-27 05:00:59
this game doesn't tell you what a strike is when opening a paid chest so the car i needed to level up one of my cards got sawped with a card that i never used. thanks game.,1,2025-09-17 07:15:04
"This game is the epitome of human creation. No other game can even compare to the level of sheer ingenuity Clash Royale expresses. (Also, stop hating on 2.6 just cuz it's good, at least it takes skill to play)",5,2025-10-03 07:25:14
"Literally Pay2Win and that's all there is to it. If you're okay with an enemy having unfair advantages over you for spending money or being paired up with players of higher level then have fun. Most people really don't even question how the differences in troop levels can influence a game highly or most of them don't seem to care. But in Clash Royale especially, as from Supercells games, you get a direct advantage in a 1v1-battle based game just by spending even a few bucks.",1,2022-06-06 14:57:55
"This game used to be fun, but it feels like it's paid to win now. I win one game, and then I match up with somebody with level 13 cards while I'm 9 and 10, and every card they have can easily counter my whole deck. I try switching it around, but of course I get counter multiple games in a row. The only solution to this problem is to buy cards and level them up.",1,2023-10-03 11:25:18
"Pretty good game. I hear everyone crying about pay to win, but I've spent under 5 pounds on the game and I'm at 6300 trophies with level 12 and 13 troops, and win most battles. The only bad things is the boat clan wars. Whoever put that in game needs to be set alight. And the fact that the cancel button has a 95% fail rate, forcing me to battle even if I cancel. Apart from these, very good game",4,2021-05-13 00:40:33
"Game must have easy cheats. When someone can drop 30 elixer worth of stuff at almost the same time, they are cheating. Cheating ruins the game. This game is like a bully. Almost every opponent is higher level ( 1 level makes a big difference in this game), WAY more powerful. Who wants to play with a bully? Game used to be fun, now not so much.",1,2022-08-17 07:28:59
"recently changed my review, evolutions are horrible, but i could put up with them but another money grab with heros? supercell you destroyed this game",1,2025-12-01 18:45:32
"Newer updates lower the game's quality more and more and the current version basically requires you to buy the battle pass to even have a chance of playing the game. Went from a genuinely enjoyable game to a sad excuse of a ""free"" game. Players who bought Pass Royale get free units only obtainable extremely late into the game that one who's at a low level simply cannot counter even if you're one level under the level you can obtain the unit. What a joke.",1,2023-04-27 19:18:30
"pay to win game , the Evo valke. is equal to infinite tornado they even got the same radius n damage for each hit of val that just crazy do you think this make sense might as well just delete tornado. with that Evo 4 elex U can do the same thing for many time that just crazy l. this game just trying to find more way to earn money next max LVL probably gonna be LVL 17 when the free to play user is close to maximise LVL for all their card for the main deck only not all card.",1,2025-12-19 22:33:36
This game used to be good. I got it in launch day and they were getting better until recent years. They started to decline drastically this game is not fun anymore. Is crazy how crazy the micro transactions are. They are charging $40 for 40 legendary cards!!! You can buy a full console game for the same price. Guys honestly don't play this is not worth your time,1,2024-12-18 03:45:46
"Dropping review from 2 to 1 star. Game has some interesting strategy, but in order to hold your own you'll need to spend money routinely to get your cards at the same level as your opponents. If you are a free to play player, your progress will be slower than the game's update schedule so you'll fall behind with daily play. If you pay to catch up, expect to keep spending money to stay relevant.",1,2023-03-31 21:37:09
I'm not going to rate low stars just because of the recent update but my rate is overall how I feel. Yes the new update is sluggish and has a great lag to it. When you play the cards it freeze thats why you see most 2v2 player leave the match. We all need to be real with ourselves that not all games are free they have to fund production and to keep the game running and if you want updates then yes its going to be more difficult to keep up with the play. Can paid players get more yes.,4,2019-07-20 01:25:46
bit hard frustrating good and a challenge fun to play but very hard annoying frustrating not many things you can get unless your the best.,3,2025-10-23 02:06:12
"Do not play this game. 2 reasons. If you're new, you can never compete unless you spend tons of money. The biggest reason though is the algorithm. If you find a great deck, you will start playing only counter decks. Once you change decks to compensate, you all of a sudden play perfect counter decks with cards you rarely saw before because they didn't counter your previous deck. This algorithm keeps you beholden to spending money. It's shameful.",1,2024-11-09 12:38:25

"CLASH ROYALE as it is. The game is fun and interesting at the beginning but after you unlock the 4th arena, everything is so bad because you will get to face players that are actually paying for the game, to cap it all this game is pay to win game and if you don't have enough money to play, don't bother downloading the game. And the game can be extremely frustrating after you get 1000 trophies. This is by far after Hay day, the worst game supercell has ever created 🖕",1,2024-06-28 15:08:53
This is a really fun game but its so pay to win its not even funny,2,2025-12-29 09:14:06
I have a free account and get paired with p2w people almost every match and if it's not a p2w kid it's someone over leveled I like the concept of the game but the matchmaking is probably the worst part and people with p2w accounts have cards you cant even unlock until 5 arenas ahead and still spam emote after a win,2,2025-09-23 07:03:17
"This is a game that went from great to the gestalt of greed. Gameplay wise this is fantastic with so many mechanics, updates, and interactions. Unfortunately the desire for more monetisation has brought over insane progression for players who are willing to spend. Those who have the same goals and who arent going to buy every $5-$30 offer will be stuck grinding for ages. The devs understand the complaints of the community and yet, still ignore the people who actually keep the game going.",3,2023-08-06 04:56:42
"terrible balance of gameplay, often times is just set to either win against weaker lower level players or get destroyed by higher level players, pretty poor gameplay development",1,2025-10-04 08:09:56
"This is a really good game, except for the rigged matching system. The AI of the game will tend to manipulate your brain's reaction to winning and losing, matching you with players in a way where you will get suspicious winning and losing streaks and often get matched to players with cards that counter yours. I stopped paying for the game as soon as i was sure that match manipulation was happening. It's still a fun game though.",3,2020-05-30 20:43:23

"It's not what it used to be, it's a pay to win game now. Tower fighters are just way too powerful and difficult to unlock. Supercell used to be one of the best but now is shamelessly forcing to make in app purchases. It's almost impossible to win flights even with troops I upgraded over the years, no different from the Chinese money grabbing games. I am going to put an end to it and will probably never play again. Had great time supercell.",1,2024-06-22 02:47:58
"worst update, pay to win game. clearly players didn't like the heroes update but supercell ignoring it and forcing updates to earn money. The rating shown is old players rating. The game is now 0 with stupid updates just to suck money from users.",1,2025-11-25 15:54:07

"Listen, I love the game. I've been playing it for years! I understand the need to make money by microtransactions. But it's so bad that and Arena 2 player can match up against someone that has 2 evolutions and a fully maxed out account, though that same opponent only has say 25 games under their belt. I find the game overly pay to win and almost impossible to play at a certain point. Maybe if you were to implement a way to filter out people that pay for boosts in the game from the ones who dont?",3,2024-03-06 06:39:20
It's fun but gets annoying after playing against pay to wins I think they should have different trophies roads so it's fair for others who arent annoying and pay to win,4,2025-11-22 08:48:31
"Some time after paying $25 for this game, it refuses to load. Was fun getting up to high arenas but became impossible to get a positive winrate because everyone has things 3/4 levels higher than mine (I'm lv9, vs lv11-13). Really doesn't make me feel good to play. If it would even open, that is. :/ Edit: it loads now. Still doesn't feel good to play against people with everything higher level than me.",3,2019-11-30 12:26:26
"I am a player with 9 years experience in this game with some breaks, it was totally different at the start, The game changed in a way that is more and more pay to win than it was before, introduced evolutions, you can buy shards for each of them. THE WORST THING and probably a mistake which would dig down that game is removal of chests and seasonal shop which was removed because it was giving too much cards, money, was just too player friendly mechanism. Now loot gain is scarse.",2,2025-04-13 13:04:49

"My Most Favourite game after chess, very strategic game ever, so loved it",5,2025-12-31 04:53:22
All I have to say is once you battle your way to the top you will only play against the same deck over and over as other players copy and use what wins the most. Possibly adjusting damage and hit points on other un used cards to level things out will make the game more interesting. At this point it's truly a waist of time. I personally like to be creative and play against creativity. Good luck,1,2023-02-02 04:45:06
Lootboxes reduce the odds of getting good cards or cards you want. The legendary cards (which are exceedingly powrful) can only be gained from an box that has dropped once for me in 20 hours. Leveling up first 7 levels out of 13 takes 6 hours and reaching level 8 takes 10 hours of constant play. Each level takes more than twice as long as the previous. Level advantages are huge and leveling up cards is expensive and difficult since they drop randomly. Ran out of characters. Do not bother playing,1,2020-12-13 05:18:43

"Progression is painfully slow, and once you max out it's pretty boring. Basically the same battles over and over. If you're looking for that, great, otherwise not so much.

"I like the game, it's fun, entertaining and cool. My only problem is that when I'm playing in a battle, it freezes do to lost connection (which I understand) but I cant play for the rest of the game, because it froze, so then I lose and it takes away my trophies. Also when I lose it takes me down an arena.😕",2,2019-11-28 09:11:47

absolutely terrible I can't play without kids using their Mommy's credit card to spend $20 to get evo mega knight and make it level 16,1,2026-01-17 13:58:07
"The games begining is good, it starts off fast and you can still slightly progress having a 50/50 Win to death ratio, on the other hand around area 4 you lose the same amount of trophies, which makes the cycle for this game insanely repetitive, knowing you'll have the same result nomatter what you do. The balance changes are neat but the progression is lethargic and makes you feel like a lot of the content is behind a brick wall",2,2022-03-03 02:14:34
Awesome game!!! Had to drop 2 stars. This is currently the only app/ game that i have that glitches. And it does it CONSTANTLY. Currently 1 in 8 losses are from flicking and freezing. I've never rage quit a game like this before. But it's not quitting if you can't do anything right? Next rage quit... It will get deleted.,3,2020-03-01 17:14:12
Ever since the wild cards came out the game has been in the decline. I don't know who thought it was a good idea to let level 11 people have level 14 cards. Please make it to where level 11s can only use level 12 or bellow cards. Mid-ladder is impossible to climb without the use of a max level mega knight destroying my level 9 hog. (Edit)It seems to have gotten WORSE. Adding mastery on cards literally mean you get more card for playing them. This means that people are more likely to use one card,2,2022-04-05 05:07:21
"was a five star rating... until I got a five star in the games and gave me the same evo I already bought and gave me nothing for compensation, ridiculous game👎",1,2025-12-07 11:28:13
Played this game for a long time now and have mixed feelings about the game. The overall concept of the game is good and that's why I still play it. However it's lost the feeling of fun for me. Unless you dump £££ into the game the grind to lvl up cards is very long The new lvl 14 towers and champions bring new things to the game but aimed at getting more cash from players who do spend if we're being honest about it.,3,2021-10-27 23:54:19
"First time leaving a review for a game and I can't believe it will be a 1*, and furthermore THIS game. Back then the simplicity and the balanced strategies were the best part of the game, paired with the mix of casual modes and actually fun Clan Wars, that gives appropriate rewards in proportion to the efforts spent. But the recent updates? They removed fun from all the game modes. Less rewards, more grinds and heavier monetization. There's no point playing if it's not fun and rewarding.",1,2023-03-28 07:53:15
decent game I wish you could fight till the very end it seems I rather always win or lose to the timer it takes the excitement out of the game and low-key can make the game suck sometimes,2,2025-10-22 07:39:26
"Supercell makes updates that takes away from the players.I've been playing the game since it came out nearly a decade ago. I've spent a decent amount of money on the game, but each card level they add takes away the progress you gained from spending money. This means you need to spend money to regain the progress you lost that you previously gained from spending hard earned money. If you are free to play, then forget it.. supercell only cares about money, not the community, not even one bit.",1,2023-12-20 02:56:55
"This game used to be a phenomenal experience. I am truly saddened by how money hungry SUPERCELL has become to let this game become such pay to play nonsense. Clash Royale used to be a game of true skill and strategy. Now, there are so many cards that are either useless or mandatory to use. I reminisce on the days in school trying to pass my friend's in trophies and I almost want to cry on CRL's current state. There's enough people who can afford pay 2 play where the game can be used by beginners",1,2025-08-27 10:37:44
"Update 2022: They change the game so often now that instead of adding new depth and ways to enjoy the game, they've made it so only a few decks can win consistently. You choose whether you want to win or want to have fun. Everyone plays with the same few decks. But they keep adding overpowered cards. And finding a clan is still insanely janky. Worst function by far. I get bored so easily, but this game has me hooked! There are no ads and you don't have to spend money to completely play and win.",3,2022-12-12 21:34:47
"Opponent matching is ridiculous, I played this game almost every day for over a year, then deleted it, after a year or so I thought I'd give it another go, that was 2 days ago, and it's still as bad, you get matched against ""people"" or maybe bots who seem to know what deck you have, and can counter you every time, it's extremely frustrating, so it's being deleted again.",1,2023-08-10 05:25:26
Now this game becomes the worst game. The match making system is worst. Always getting player of high level (upto 2-3 level more) having fully upgraded card. I think it's game policy to not allow players to reach the highest number of trophies. Very bad experience and I think I need to stop playing this game because I always get frustrated after the game because of those matching. Need to fix this problem as soon as possible.,1,2020-09-29 23:12:04

This was a very fun game. It felt like skill actually mattered. Then clan wars 2 dropped. Now it's a game that is forcing players to pay to win and earn gold rewards. The old clan war level used to be one underneath max. Allowing for the last level earned for ladder game play easier if you were more skilled than other players. Now it's nothing but lvl 13s getting the advantage because they are already maxed. Anyone else not there seems forced to pay a lot of money to catch up. Game ruined.,1,2020-09-02 18:11:47
"Everytime during a match it automatically disconnects from the server leaving behind the network error sign and after connecting again after turning on and off airplane mode , I see that I already lost the game, this is such disturbing and reducing the progress that I made.

"The developers have taken a wonderful game and ruined it by being completely out of touch. Endless clicking and waiting for tiresome graphics, ploys to raise money (I'm happy to pay for the game passes, but how about some honesty). FINALLY, they're asking for input about the game (fixing the barn door AFTER all the horses have left). 5 million gold in my account and gems that have no use. Senseless limits on rewards for new accounts (why start playing when you can't catch up without paying $$$$)",1,2025-01-24 09:59:50

This game literally allows only some ways to get the champion cards in the update and it's very hard to receive them as you basically have to be extremely good at the game to just get one champion card. Also if you really want to get a lot of cards you have to spent 50 dollar plus. The game is good and I would rate it a 5 stars if there was an easier way to get more of the rarer cards like champion cards,1,2022-12-28 19:56:44
"This game has turned upside down. One of the worst outcomes possible. I've been playing since the beta, and the game has gotten worse with every update. Clearly this is nothing but a cash cow to the developers. Every new card or evolution they release, they make sure it is overpowered so you spend money to upgrade/get it, especially with the exclusive shop offers, which are way too overpriced btw, to make people spend their money. Worst example of greed possible. Avoid as a new player.",1,2024-05-13 06:01:41
"great game concept, but uh... in one word? cashgrab. Don't play if you expect some f2p. after u go to arena 8 it's just such a pain to progress because of the P2P players.

Now they have locked so many of the advantageous features of the game behind a pay wall that you will struggle to be competitive against people that spend money. you will need to spend 3 to 4 years playing non stops or spend over $200 to be somewhat competitive. many players are spending well over $500. imagine what else you can get for $500. it's ridiculous.,2,2025-04-23 00:32:37
the game is fun when you are winning and have destroyed one of someone's tower until they get better card spawns than you and you can defend so they are wiping all your units out while they spawn more also it annoys me how my opponent most of the time has better cards or higher leveled cards like how is that fair? how is a Evo wizard and furnace fair to have when we are in arena 4?,1,2025-08-29 05:08:30

"The game WAS good before the last update. Since the update, a lot of people have had issues. I've had a lot of lag in the game since the update which affects my game, 2vs2 & the clan. I have been constantly informing the support team but they are NOT ABLE to Resolve the issue. They kept of repeating the same troubleshooting steps despite of mentioning to them that I have tried everything. Now they even STOP RESPONDING to messages as they know they can't resolve the issue. Guess time to uninstall!",2,2019-10-10 06:32:04
I used to like this so much that I would have given it five stars but you recently made changes to the game that make it super awful. You used to be able to do special type battles with the decks. You've been leveling continuously and now it's blocked behind caps and everything is level Eleven. Also wanting more money to play really sucks too. The only way I can have fun With other types of games other than guild war and plain battle is to do the friendly battle but someone has to be online,1,2023-04-27 02:44:44

"I think the game has become huge... It has made many improvements since I last played and I think Supercell really enjoys their game! I wish it was a bit more balanced but I understand how hard that can be. I wish every card was viable. Edit: 4 years later and they have completely lost their minds. They have become money centralized, it used to be Free to play, pay to win. Now its more so Pay to play sell your soul to win. You have to invest money into the game or invest 10 hours a day.",3,2023-03-27 23:28:45

"Not technically pay to win because you can get everything leveled up for free, but it will take you actual real time years to max out. I've had this game nearly since it came out and I'm still not max level. Once you progress to the ranks where you're facing max level players, you will lose 9/10 times if they have any iota of skill. Also, very frequently get disconnected during games over wifi and data with full bars. Core gameplay is very very fun, but way too frustrating if you're poor.",2,2023-11-13 04:06:24

Please apply Sir Tag's suggestions outlined in his recent youtube video. There are ways to give players a sense of progression without messing with card levels. Until our concerns are addressed, my rating for this app will remain one star. Also, I think it's unfair that you are changing the mastery rewards from gems to gold.

But it lasts only for couple of weeks and you get annoyed again. Then an update comes and you install it again, and so on. The dev team is also not listening to players.

It also feels like my elixar is alot slower than my opponents, they can place many cards while I barely can place one. Fix your game before you lose us",2,2020-08-05 20:59:43
All right at first but then once you get to arena 5 you lose like every game and it's extremely pay to win. Also its annoying how you have to get tokens in order to actually trade with the trader. Btw you usually win your first match with ease and then you lose every match after because your opponents are two levels higher than you. Do not recommend. It might seem like fun at first but the more you play the more likely your going to throw your phone.,1,2023-01-29 02:23:13
It's a fun game but matching system is a little off you will be level 6 going against a level 11 it is suppose to go off your arena rank but I've come across players who have heros that aren't given until later on. It wouldn't be a problem if it wasnt a weird match up like that as much as it is. Game is a great f2p though you can buy the battle pass for 5 usd a month to get lots of rewards and level up faster. I'm only doing a 2* because of the weird matching system.,2,2019-12-03 16:48:03

"Game went downhill with the string of new updates. Became very paid to win and "" special deals "" heavy. I can understand making things cost money with microtransactions, but this does it or you pay 40 bucks to maybe possibly get a level for one of your cards. While you can get the evolutions free to play it takes so much longer compared to somebody who can just pay for it right out of pocket. Especially with having to buy the $10ish diamond pass to unlock the goblin mortar. It's a shame.",1,2023-07-28 00:24:07
"Game has gone downhill from when it was created. After not enough updates, they decided to try improving the game and ended up doing too many updates which is bad for a lot of reasons. Firstly i enjoyed the game prior to the updates, but updates are apart of trying to improve the game so i was fine with it. But they kept doing balance changes on the troops which is extremely annoying to constantly relearn. Overall its okay but its nowhere near where it once was.

Advancement has been neutered.

"a game that could be good if the business behind it wasn't so soulless. The game's design is like a 1-2 minute match of rock paper scissors.

Skill expression is repressed in favor of the needs of the business to keep you playing and buying using tricks. it's not a game, really, it's digital manipulation.",1,2025-06-28 00:19:50

Can't play this game anymore and I'm really sad since it's a game I really like. Until this gets fixed I won't be playing the game anymore.",3,2019-02-10 08:55:26
Played the game as a free to play player for nearly 2 years. Pay to win wall was passable with abit of skill and patience. Last patch killed it imo. You had the option to take a book and a champion card for free! Now you have to choose 1 of them (you have to still use some green gems in order to take champion). And the new challenge road doesn't give you the option to unlock new champion but only yo level the ones you have.... ridiculous. Overall pretty solid game. Don't make IT MORE PAY TO WIN!,1,2023-04-28 06:18:11
The game is pretty fun I must admit! But mostly super unfair! It only becomes enjoyable once you max out some of your cards and you can fairly compete with your opponents and until this happens you will always be matched with a player who's cards are 2 to 3 times higher than your own! Match making is a joke unfortunately! And good luck grinding through the frustrating games you'll play till you manage to max out a few cards which also limits you to only play thoes few wich also gets a bit boring,3,2022-06-18 02:31:15
"This game is good, but developpers should make it better , because after finnishing the match for example, and you are clicking on the screen random clicks ,when it's loading , you enter a second match or 2v2 match , or you open a box randomly ,how did this happen !! . And also there is another thing that supercell companie should do , and that is to make this game a pc game also , because there is so many pc gamers that love to play clash royale on PCs .",3,2021-02-25 16:49:24

"I enjoy playing the game overall...when it's a good matchup. I feel that that Supercell's algorithm (if they even have one) is very poor when you get paired against someone who is a least two king levels a head of you and their cards are leaps a head as well. I never experience almost any anger and impatience, except when I play this game. Like I said, it can be fun, but only in the small chance that you get an opponent that is also closely matched in levels of both towers and cards, to your own",2,2021-11-25 08:22:12
"A great game However, late game, it can get very frustrating. This is because there is not enough to do for a long amount of time. If you play ladder (the main competitive gamemode) for a long period of time, the matchmaking becomes hard. There is not much else to do that seems fun, relatively balanced, and still rewarding. IMO this is down to a few mistakes by the dev team in a row (ie. Trophy change, CW2), but they are mistakes. Overall; 5☆ for early - mid game late game lets it down to a 3.5☆",4,2021-01-04 17:52:45
"Such an immense dissapointment. The community waited 2.5 years for a major update and new way to play the game, but was given a worse version of the default game mode. The game is unplayable because you either fight AI bots at low levels or real players who spent hundreds of dollars to get an insurmountable level advantage over you. I quit this game because it was taking a mental toll on me. The matches are so toxic and I cannot enjoy it anymore -- it's more of a stress inducer than a fun break.",1,2020-10-26 21:06:34

Whatever balancing updates they have done have not worked. The game is still dominated by the same few cards, Mega Knight, Hog Rider, Goblin Barrell, etc. Used to be great, not so anymore. Just not fun.",1,2024-12-18 22:44:50

"Basicly they will pick 2 or 3 cards a month that with absolute destroy everything, and if you dont use them you will have a hell of a time ever winning.

"Most recent update absolutely neutered progression across the board, with absolutely no signs of the devs changing their minds.

"Evos killed this game. I played over 100 matches and in EIGHTY OF THEM the opponent was running a mega knight evo. Absolutely horrid job from the balancing team. New players beware it is the most offensive cash grab you'll ever see. I don't see a value in anything this game has to offer anymore. The ""sales"" are adjusted pricing they've always had and I'm now finding inconsistencies in the ""x5 value"" type popups. They don't even know what they actually charge for some of these micro transactions.",1,2025-02-02 13:47:46
This game sucks the level differences are crazy the creators dont care about the commuinty and they only care about money,1,2026-01-08 19:46:34
They've killed the game even further. It used to be so good. This is unironically the most pay-to-play game on the app store now. They basically turned a few months progression into multiple years. You need to drop money just to unlock a new rare card. It's almost impossible to get new cards now. CR Community is up in arms but Supercell doesn't care.,1,2025-04-09 00:05:21
"This game has reached its most pay to win point yet. It is impossible to beat higher levels without paying money for evo , pass royale et cetera. When you are at your closest to reaching the next arena ( example , 29 trophies ) , the matchmaking gives you literally 2 or 3 less trophies always. Then you will have to play again and lose like 3 times until you can progress to the next arena. The algorithm has made it so that you have to lose 3/5 games you play. This game has reached a low point",2,2024-04-18 11:44:37
Dead game. Been playing this ever since beta. It's so sad to see such a beloved game of mine go this direction. Menu's are extremely complicated and most things seem like the devs are in cash grab mode before the game completely dies. You more or less have to pay to stay on top. The level 15 addition was just a way for Supercell to take your money. 2v2 used to be fun but is a joke now. Teammates leave match or troll you with no repercussions.,1,2023-12-24 19:29:54
"They added level 16 making the game more pay to win. I am hardstuck in Arena 18 when i should be in arena 23 but the matchmaking sucks and I always lag at the start, then guess what? A full megaknight prince push 3 crowning me. Yeah. Dont start this game its going to die. They then added heros and deleted elite wild cards for a trash gem conversion rate.

"After winning a few matches this game will match you with someone who has clearly paid to level their cards up. It takes a solid 10 seconds to scroll past all the paid offers in the shop to the things you can buy with in-game currency. Absolutely ludicrous. The game itself is pretty good and that can't be denied at all - if it wasn't p2w it would be perfect. The matching between players is rigged against those who are f2p and puts you against higher levels. Why, if there are players your level?!",1,2024-11-14 03:08:56
This is a great game and I have been playing for quite a while. The problems I have been having have come about since the update the beginning of July. My store wont load and will force stop the game every time I tap it. Cards take for ever to place... mid game it stops the game and makes me restart which ends in me losing that match. I have lost mutiple matches due to this. I can never play 1v1 because i dont trust me staying in the match long enough to win. Please fix.,4,2019-07-05 01:02:39
"Overall, not a bad game if you put time into it. Reason for the 3 star is because of the reintroduction of the 1:1 trophy loss after already getting bad feedback the first time around. Especially with the excuse of things being ""more rewarding"" and ""more balanced matchups"" which, Is not true at all. update: started playing again after a longer hiatus, I came back to see that there's now an added ""premium"" pass, for basically the same rewards you used to get before with the regular one. 1☆",1,2024-06-05 03:10:06
"The games great, but every single time there is an update, new problems appear. The chests take about 5 seconds to display the first card, donating cards don't appear till 3-5 later, if I try to play a match right away every single card is delayed. I'll drop the wizard about 3 seconds later he appears and then his deploy timer starts wasting even more damn time.",1,2018-09-30 03:39:10
"simply put, terrible. pay to ""compete"". used to enjoy this game, but once you get to higher levels, it is unbearable. you can either spend way too much money to have a chance to compete or spend 9 more months after spending longer than that to get to high levels, to maybe get 1 card at max level. then, if you're not using the Meta decks, it doesn't matter how good you are. also, why is the battle pass more expensive than every triple-A console/pc game? fortnite is only 9$, ya'll are charging 12$",1,2025-05-02 21:38:23
Every year I come to the game and every year its the same boring slop more worse from the last time ive played the game for 7 years back then it was simple place a card defend push and have fun the cards for each arena matched every arena not like now where you start to unlock legendaries at arena 11. every single guy has level 15 cards when my cards are barely level 13 and my king tower is 13 today broke me 7 lose streak with the same repetitive hog cycle mega Knight and pekka cycle p2w or lose,1,2025-10-13 18:54:34

"Legit just a storefront with a game attached. Pass Royale, gems, and the lootboxes are not condusive to this style of strategy game in my opinion. Whilst there is some strategy within the deck-building, the vast majority of battles are determined by card and king levels, which always seems to be vastly unbalanced at higher leagues. This ends up in losses feeling frustrating and wins feeling meaningless. However, I do remember lower leagues being fun, and occasionaly you do get a balanced match.",3,2021-07-19 18:21:50

You gotta pay up, buy coins and gems to have an edge.",1,2022-06-27 15:54:02
Game was fun but after getting an s10 this game lags terribly and crashes constantly. I was better off with my s7 and that phone was terrible. Get it together. In the middle of a game signal will just drop off and when it comes back I got 3 crowned. That is one of the most infuriating things I've ever had happen and it's not just once here or there. It's damn near every match. Edit still happening. No changes to the crashes. Edit tried again still happening.,1,2020-07-13 01:49:38
Extremely good game bu the only problem is that the updates are not accurate,3,2025-12-02 07:15:33
it's an ok time killer but the skill level required is high and the difference can be razor thin. Building your deck unless very creative is like playing a janken game. It's easy to use even if there kinda greedy with how much cash they want for there services or the lack of services. as creative as the concept is that's kinda where the creativity stopped or slowed to the slowest of crawls. It's small frustrating and expensive to catch up. all that said it's very addictive.,4,2019-01-29 07:28:00

"If you think about getting back into this game after not playing for good while: Don't! Before it was manageable as f2p or by only buying the pass each month, but now with the evolutions which cost 10,- each and the changes to pass it's impossible to catch up without dumping a ton of money into it. I had pretty decent card levels for the decks I've played but it's hard to have fun when you're constantly outleveled and out evolutioned. Last time they added higher levels it was at least adjusted!",2,2024-07-15 23:14:17
"The game used to be a lot of fun, but Supercell seems absolutely determined to alienate its players and push profits as opposed to listen to their community and creators. This game is becoming more slop with each update. The introduction of heroes and level 16 being the only the most recent example. They show no sign of stopping and are continuing to make bad choices. I recommend uninstalling the game to discourage this behavior. Stop giving them money, and find your entertainment elsewhere.",1,2026-01-21 15:30:08

They are always either spamming their no-skill cards like Mega-Knight, Elite Barbarians, or Electro-Giant +rage. Or they are 2+ king levels higher than you with cards that are 3+ levels higher that any of your cards. Though, when they give you a fair game, it can be pretty fun.

Honestly I thought it'd be fun to play again but the state of the game now is making me feel that i should stop. Too many pay to win players are rising with barely a year or less playing while us veterans who play for free are stuck in a limbo where we can't progress because lower level people have higher level cards than us and we can't level them up without winning and vice versa. It's an endless loop that some of us can't leave unless we cough up money.,2,2021-11-16 04:55:41

"OMFG this new update has made the game completely unplayable! I thought the last major update that allowed the devs to suck more money from the players was bad enough. It made the game slower to load, slower to load the actual battle. The game was crashing 2 of 3 2v2 games. But now it is crashing 80% of 1v1 games. When a select a card, there is a 1 sec pause. When i play that catd, there is another 2 sec pause. Makes spells impossible to hit, and makes it impossible to get my troops out in time.",1,2019-10-01 00:11:33
"It's a very good game, but I don't feel like giving it 5 stars. I don't like the fact that when you lose connection you lose trophies. I'd suggest a change of rules or something like 15-30 seconds the game stops, waiting for the player to get the net back, and this can happen like just once and if he loses connection again things will work like they already do. Or I would set it that if you lose connection and then lose the battle you don't lose trophies but the opponent still wins. Not fair tho",3,2022-03-30 16:55:22
Don't get me wrong the game is fun and creative. But it gets annoying when your connection is great yet the game keeps lagging and you lose due to that. Also I get you need money but some of these prices are ridiculous. $20 for one book?... Seriously???? It's ashame how greed tends to win. You'd think the people in charge would be loyal to those who made their game a success but it seems like that's always forgotten at some point.,3,2023-03-01 19:42:05

I already match up with people with cards 3 levels above mine with the current matchmaking, and dealing with level 14 will be even worse.

Around king level 28, you have to upgrade a fk ton of cards to level up any further. And if you are trying to build a single deck, it won't work.

Could easily go for 4 to 5 stars. But the matchmaking system is pure trash. You get stronger units the more points you get. So I keep getting matched with players with 400-600 even 4000+ points higher than me. In game this means they have 3-8 higher tier units than me so basically there is no point in trying to fight back. Moreover there is no surrender button to at least end the fiesta.

"Been playing this game since it came out, spent hundreds of dollars on it, at first it was real fun, but now it's unplayable! Before, the matches were balanced in terms of av. elixir and type of cards like air, ground, defense, but now it's super unbalanced! I'm level 13 with maxed out decks, and 90% of the time I'm matched against an unbeatable deck! it's a rare occasion that skill is the factor of winning a match even if I'm the winner, most of my wins are also of an unbalanced decks :/",1,2020-04-16 00:39:23
"This game is the wurst! There seems to be no way there is enough players for me to have a match every time I want one, which means the overlords running the game have BOT players to fill the void. Those bots use cards in a way that make them look enticing to real players, hence they spend money. This is good for the overlord makers of the ever changing game bad for players that just want to have fun. Cards are changed frequently, which creates inconsistency, it's matching system is unfair!",1,2022-03-05 14:05:35
really fun game but the only problem is people just pay to win,4,2026-01-01 08:03:48
My main problem with Supercell games is the way opponents are matched. Rarely are opponents match equally. You can work hard and get a good deck just to play someone who has a far advanced deck and not because they bought it but because the game pairs people based to trophies which a player can manipulate. It would be far more fair if you couldn't leave the arena you advanced to instead of able to fall back to play easier players.,2,2022-11-26 21:34:17
"The game is horrible. The match making is terrible, I'm constantly paired with people that are high level or have high level card. It takes forever to level up your cards, forcing you to pay lots of money just to even stand a chance against someone. The majority of the game doesn't favor skill it favors you out leveling your opponent. I have never played a game where all our cards and towers were the same level there is always 1-3 level difference.",1,2021-04-10 07:55:02
"i always wondering why there was differences when everytime i won or lose the match, the crown reward are not balance. i am level 14 and my opponent was 12 or 13, my two archer are still alive and haven't received any damage, yet the crown i recieved is 27, 28 , 29 or if was lucky enough i would get 30. but if my opponent were much way higher than i am, and i lose the crown deduction is 30 to 33, are you serious about the system?? come on",1,2026-01-24 22:24:10
"The best card in the game is a parents credit card. This game is unplayable due to the fact that people can just buy whatever they want. If you spend money then you are guaranteed to win easy as that. Most pay to win game I've ever played. Wish I could review it as a 0 to .5 but one is the lowest. If you install, have a credit card in hand if you plan on winning. Especially if you get to high arenas.",1,2019-09-27 18:15:03
"Most frustrating game I've ever played between getting placed with players more than 2 levels higher than me and level 13 egiants and ebarbs running over me. I have simply lost interest in this game, and got to the point where I have to choose if I want to have fun or use cards that give me an unfair advantage over every other person trying to have fun. In the beginning of playing it was fun creating your own card combos but at this point it is just copying the most annoying deck. Just not fun.",1,2021-11-23 22:22:21
Too many forms of currency in the game. Turtle slow pace of advancement especially after the update to evolution cards and level 15. Pay to play is their way. For the love of God give the player the option to turn off chest animations. Id give two stars back just for that. Used to love this game but I give up stuck at level 13 for so long and XP is so slow. Facing level 15s. So more of the same vs SC always deals out.,1,2023-07-25 18:21:04

"Stop giving fasle notifications to try to help engagement! For the past month or so (and I reported it instantly), the game has been sending me notifications such as ""Plentiful crate unlocked/gold chest unlocked"" when it isn't. At first I thought it was a bug, but soon realised it was probably done by design to make the open the app more. Going to uninstall and keep reporting this and giving low ratings if it doesn't get fixed, it feels super sleezy and I won't support this.",1,2025-02-17 17:48:16
"I've been playing Clash Royale for 7 years. When it first started the game require lots is strategy and competitions were really fun. Now, with the integration of evolved cards it has changed the game from strategic to more arcade type. There are just something's that aren't fair, and Supercell knows that those paying and giving them money are the ones with the upper hand. It's just been a 7 year slope of greed increase. And truly make me miss the nostalgic Clash Royale from 5, 6 years ago.",1,2023-07-05 18:39:30
"At this point I think the game is rigged. I've been playing it for a short time, but everytime I run into somebody that some how puts cards that are 4 elixir every teo seconds. The game is also pay to win. I was playing a match when I was still in arena 7 and the guy I was fighting had a level 14 Prince. The game used to be fun, but because of all the pay to win players it has become annoying and frustrating.",1,2024-03-01 15:08:34
I personally had a terrible experience with this game. As a kid I played this game as soon as it came out and I've experienced WiFi lag when my wifi isn't the problem. I've also ran into unfair battles. When I was a level 7 I'd play against level 10s. The game is terrible and they almost try and make kids smash their devices. Step up the game real sad,1,2020-04-08 09:32:48
this game is so pay to win it's unplayable for free to play players I can't even get to the next arena because people are buying all the evos and I can't defend it with anything I have please make this less pay to win,1,2025-10-26 05:28:05
"Until Supercell can figure out how to make something on the lines of a decent matchmaking system instead of the first other acc available, this rating stands. As enjoyable as the game can be, it is simply too frustrating to constantly lose because you are playing against people upwards to 2 levels higher than you and decks that automatically win because they out level your cards. It basically means that every time this happens, you are basically wasting 3-6 minutes of your life. It adds up...",2,2019-12-25 16:44:03
I have a Supercell ID on Clash Royale. I went to play one day last week and it asked me to sign in. I always have remember me checked. I proceeded to enter my email to obtain the verification code and nothing has been sent for a few days now. Not in spam or anything. There is no way to ask support if you can't log on. Makes no sense why it would kick me out from time to time.,2,2021-03-15 02:35:45
1. You really need to add new characters to the season. 2. Many players have no place for growth. Up the coin cap from 5 million. 3. Why working on banners is a priority is beyond me... 4.Star points add no value... 5. Only a few champions. 6. War is getting boaring I would really like to see more units different from classes and variety... I'm really struggling to play this game. This used to be a fun game.,2,2023-03-20 15:22:40
"just updated today and it keeps crashing now every few seconds. pls fix. my friend's iphone7 kept crashing as well after the update.. update - 28Jan2019. i ran the game and it asked for update. I updated it and it kept asking for update then kicked me out to play store. Like some infinite loop. I've just re-installed the game , ran it again and it still asks for an update. GREAT JOB! Now I can't even go in!",1,2019-01-28 20:15:19
"This game has gotten less and less fun to play as time went on. I've been playing for 5 years on and off. The progression and useless updates that changed the game starting after clan wars 2 (which came out a few years ago) has just sent this game into a downward spiral. The game feels a lot more pay to win then before and you have to spend hundreds of dollars to max your account out or tons of hours, whereas it used to be relatively easy but difficult.",1,2023-08-03 13:30:15

"Edited: I recently lost several emotes, some of which were limited and I paid for. Basically got an apology and told there was nothing they could do. They didn't even try to help. Very poor. Been playing for free for years, love it! Paying doesn't really give you an advantage as chests are all random anyway. Even with the new monthly subscriptions, it just allows you to open chest faster. once you have a deck of level 14 cards however, it's just skill and luck that can push you further.",1,2022-07-29 05:20:58
"I like the game but i think it's ruining itself with the pay 2 win. Instead of waiting to open chests you can buy gems and open them direct. You can buy cards in the shop. This is supposed to be an strategy game but how can it be it if people can buy better cards and chests by using gems. If you look at other games from SUPERCELL every game is built of the ""buy gems and get better faster"" concept and I don't like that. But still it's an fun game.",2,2019-05-28 02:20:31
"Tried to get into Clash Royale again, the game is progressively becoming even more Pay to Win than before. Game is fun, but ruined by greed. They have intentionally developed a system that places the idea of spending money, since every other player you face, especially on a win streak, will have everything be higher level compared to yours. After a certain point, the games are 25% based on skill, 75% on who has higher king level and cards.",1,2021-10-22 05:21:28

"The game's progression feels stagnant and unrewarding, leaving players feeling frustrated. Many matches become repetitive and predictable, lacking strategic depth. Updates often introduce imbalance and further complicate gameplay. The reliance on microtransactions creates an uneven playing field, hindering enjoyment for those who choose not to spend. Overall, the experience feels less about skill and more about luck and spending.",1,2025-05-01 22:11:07

full on pay to win now. also slow af loading after new hero update.,1,2025-12-06 16:18:21
do not download this game.Believe me or not im on 7 losing streak. I'm only in arena 3 and almost every person I went to play against literally had unlimited elixir or something? this game is just money grab and stressing,1,2025-09-28 09:43:32
great game so fun and alot of upgrades for all of the cards,5,2025-11-26 04:57:34
"The game used to have charm, strategy, and non invasive ways of making the player want to play the game. Nowadays, the game forces you to rigorously play in order to keep up with the paying players. The game has changed to the point where they fill your screen with micro transactions to the point where it's worse than apps with ads. The developers attempt to monetize every opportunity they get, especially when there is new content. The cards that cost money are insanely overpowered on release.",1,2024-09-04 20:37:44

It's very pay to win. Fun game though.,1,2025-11-26 08:09:40
This is one of the most addictive games I have ever played. My only two suggestions are you should add a wifi/data free mode and be able to customize the training thing(the bot fight) Edit: Fix Matchmaking and this game would be great... I shouldn't get paired against a lvl 11 or higher If I'm level 8. Also it's VERY pay to win nowadays.,3,2020-08-28 13:05:44
Used to be a great game with the old war system. New one is terrible. The game certainly cheats for the players that pay for the pass. Unfair matchmaking and unfair war system. 2v2 and random play is the only good thing about this game. They have changed this game around multiple times now and it just keeps getting worse. It's all about how much money will you pay to win.,1,2023-06-19 22:25:16
heroes are good but add more cards. and 1 evo and 1 hero a month.,5,2026-01-07 10:40:14
"Firstly, I have to admit that I did spent a bit of money, just on one royale pass, but it didn't feel like cheating or being better at the game (in the end, it resides inside you), but instead, I see it as way to advance faster. I notice that there's a lot of people roasting the game just for being a F2P that needs some kind monetization to simply exist; I find absurd the criticism of so many people saying that the game is unplayable, you just have to get more involved in the game, try new decks",5,2022-04-04 21:51:24
realy fun love playing with friends and getting to go into a clan,5,2025-12-22 15:34:56
in general get rid of mega kight its annoying and tbh the game needs to be ranked on skill level or exact same king tower not trophy get rid of pay to win and pay to loose,2,2025-12-21 07:14:53
"Somewhat entertaining game. Unfortunately, it is the age old problem with these games, the companies get greedy. This one has made it so the only way to advance is to spend obscene amounts of money or take months. The initially jacked their monthly buy in by nearly 100% then they made it so that everything else costs too. Good to start but once you get near the top, it is time to drop.",2,2023-08-12 20:03:04
"I joined so that I can play with my friends, but it turns out, everytime you lose, it automatically gives you a harder opponent to battle and you end up not going up the arenas. Also, if you want to progress in the game, you have to pay money for it. Finally, the devs of this game have added too many evolutions that do no good towards your progress in the games. Some are too broken or some are too bad. I really don't like this game and I want to delete it asap.",2,2024-07-01 01:22:04

this game is just a money grab and never let's you get into another arena unless you get lucky or spend money,1,2026-01-17 05:36:26
"This is your basic pay-to-win app. Unless you blow a boat load of money rapidly updating your cards, which I am guessing would cost as much as a couple of Playstation 4s, you're at the mercy of kids who probably maxed out their parents credit card so they can gloat about how great they are in virtuosity. This is a fun little time waster if you can get over the fact it's fixed for those who spend a lot of money. I wouldn't spend a cent on it, but it's worth a download if you spend a lot of time on teleconferences. There's a lot of weird things that happen during the game that would appear as though their are hacks or cheats. But keeping in mind that these guys didn't develop the game for altruistic reasons and are looking for a profit, that's not a head scratcher. Again, it seems like the intent on the part of CR is to make money, and that doesn't happen with people who play the game for free, so you will likely suffer way more losses than win unless you want to blow bank on this phone app.",1,2021-06-17 05:14:11
The recent changes to the game are kinda not good. The new event system is boring and the new gamemodes are the same repetitive unfun mush capture this unit or use this overpowered card. It feels like the game really doesn't want you to play it so why play a game that doesn't want you to have fun playing it. The worst part is that the core gameplay of clash royale is very fun. Everything just happens to try as hard as possible to make sure you don't experience that.,1,2023-05-18 11:51:14
The core mechanics of the game are somewhat fun and addicting. However the game is so disgustingly pay to win that every match no longer comes down to skill. It just comes down to whoever has spent more money on the game and has higher upgradeded card levels. If this game had no card level system it would be so much better. However you can clearly see the developers have stopped caring about the game and only care about monetization.,1,2023-08-14 09:34:43
i hate just hate how they only allow the stuff you have in trophy road instead of having everything like 2 updates ago and this game is so toxic,1,2025-12-10 09:03:24
"This game is so unbalanced. It'll put you up against way more experienced players with way higher level stuff than you. It needs a better ranking system. Also, the you basically need to buy gold once you get passed a certain point to level up your stuff which you need to do is you want to keep up. It doesn't do a good job of teaching you how to play, and if you're opponent has something you've never seen before you're most likely screwed. if you get frustrated easy, stay away. Not enjoyable.",1,2019-11-12 10:18:48

This game never wanted anyone to feel overpowered from day one installing the game.",5,2022-03-30 18:09:26
"I would want to give this higher stars because it is a fun game but the matchmaking is just broken, and SC has this automated response for their ""help"" so leaving a review seems to be the only way to get them to read something from a player pov.

"This game is literally cancerous. It's a deck game where you create your deck and have 1v1 (or 2v2) with others. Problem is that there are so many p2w (pay to win: people who use too much money in the game and get ahead of others) that you often have hard time playing if you dont wanna spend your money on the game.

After the update, everything got converted into these “jewel” items I never asked for, and now my progress is basically reset. I already put in the time, grinding and saving the resources I needed. Instead of letting me use what I’d earned, the new system forces extra steps, new currency, and more grinding just to reach the same point I was at before. It feels like my e.",1,2025-12-07 22:00:55
clash Royale is one of the best and most enjoyable strategy games that I've ever played. unfortunately there's an incredible P2W problem! for context each card level gives cards roughly a 10% increase to the stats of the previous level card. if you don't spend money on the game your opponent often will have 2-3 level higher cards. meaning their troops will be 21-32%~ stronger than yours because they spent money and you didn't. if you. are rich sure have fun. otherwise don't bother,1,2025-12-11 04:22:59
"It's fun but expect alot of mico transaction, and cheap gameplay. If you don't level up your stuff then you will be at a sever disadvantage. Match ups are not equal, vary rarely will it be skill that wins a match. It's mainly a ""who has the higher level stuff"" kind of game. Once you reach the top top tier you have to have statagy but until you have been playing for a long while or dropped a couple hundred in micro transaction you will taper off and hit a elo hell stage quickly.",1,2021-04-10 00:28:36

You get ludicrous benefits for paying, it may be a small amount of money, but you're paying to enjoy. it is painfully obvious when you are facing someone paying to win, all of their cards are better, higher level, evo, and you can do nothing. unless you pay. To summarise, the game is designed to make you pay by making the experience unbearable without paying. 0 stars if I could, it's the heroin of mobile games.",1,2025-12-18 16:13:41
"Could be a really fun game, but just when you think it can’t get more pay-to-win, it does. If you take a break from playing, don’t expect to enjoy coming back unless you’re ready to spend money. The meta is heavily dominated by Evo cards, and without them, you’ll constantly be at a disadvantage against players who have paid to stay competitive.

Ive played on and off for 6 years and it was my favorite mobile game but recent updates have destroyed the core concepts of the game making the game about paying for broken heroes instead of using skills like proper placement and strategy.

"This update killed the game for me. Removed all books and gave a small amount of gems. Made changes that require said books more than ever. and the game is not 100% pure Pay to Win. Making evos was bad enough, now you have made special Heroes which can only be obtained by spending money. 1 hero is given for free and it is the worst one. Out of 4 heroes, the Giant is the worst and 96% of the people received the giant as their free hero. everything else is locked behind a pay wall",1,2025-12-08 19:13:50

Even though matches last only a few minutes, each battle is packed with decisions that matter.

all this is about pay to win. You will be matched up with pay to win players (whose tower/cards are levels above/evo/hero). this game ain't worth the time unless you are willing to spend money on it.

The game clearly favors people who pay over those who don't, because of the Evo cards. the introduction of those cards simply degraded the quality of the game. It once was a great game.

"This is the most pay to win game I have ever played in my life. The executive designers don't care about the average player. Their updates are actively hostile towards their player base and anti-f2p (free to play). I have never seen anything like it, they don't care about their player base and they don't care about new players. To play a match you need a deck composed of 8 cards, to be able to max these to be on equal footing and compete you would need to spend over a year playing or pay $200+",1,2025-11-26 10:21:38
First 2 games of the new update we're fine. After going against a level 16 evo witch that physically cannot die while my cards are level 10-11 I'm done. I thought the free evo meant something good for the game but they're just trying to make up for the dumb stuff they're pulling to absolutely farm money and clearly it's working on some people. This game is ridiculous.,1,2025-11-29 12:09:52
"Honestly the devs completely ruined the game when they had something good going. I'm a f2p player and have pushed past 10k trophies and I can say confidently the difference between 10k and 15k is the amount of money you've spent on the game and whether you will play the meta or not. Nothing but bridge spam and logbait anymore, so boring even when you win, only entertaining at the highest level but good luck getting there since they consistently make it harder to progress as f2p every update.",2,2025-11-20 11:57:41
"Pay to win was the reason I'm giving this low score. Like I want to play as fun and competitive as any competitive game out there. But bad things just happened. The more I play, the more I see people using evo, high level troops, and higher tower level. It is still in the low-mid arena. It wasn't fun anymore.",1,2025-12-17 15:01:03
Just made it to one of the highest arenas. To be unbiased. The f2p aspect is horrible. Progression this way would be slowed. There are some arenas (that happened to me) I would get stuck because I was underleveled (totally didn't involve my skill) one level higher isn't bad. I shouldn't be facing a lvl 14 MK while being lvl 11. Evo shards have gotten easier but still hard to get quite a few. It's a great game yet I wouldn't invest anything into the app until the new update releases.,3,2025-11-23 12:52:02
"This game used to be one of my favorites, but now it's become blatantly pay-to-win. The developers made promises years ago that they have gone back on (no level 15, now there's level 16; no rarities above legendary, now there's champions). The devs don't care for game balance because it's more profitable to make people spend hundreds of dollars on the newest overpowered cards.",1,2025-12-07 10:40:58
"Literally no reason to play the game. Mega Knight is so ridiculous and in order to play the game you HAVE to have a counter in your deck for it because it is that strong and requires ZERO skill to play and a ridiculous amount of timing, knowledge, and the right cards in hand to counter.

I seriously cannot overstate how unfun the game is and do not recommend this game unless you're looking to blow money.",1,2025-12-13 12:36:48

game just isn't fun anymore I only ever see three decks and it seems like if I don't play one of those three I can't win. being toxic seems to be encouraged now. the addition of level 16 and heroes just destroyed my ability to be competitive since I'd just started to get level 15 cards and evos. seriously there's no point in playing this game anymore. it's just not fun.,1,2026-01-08 13:55:16
"Worst game. Only if you got overflowing wallet you gonna have a fun time. Not only that, developers do everything that people are telling them that they DON'T want.

They suddenly add lvl 16 to the game.",1,2025-11-26 05:40:19
Ive seen a lot of talk about recent patches bringing back the old feel of Royale...it hasn't. The monetization is still nuts. One level difference between a certain troop could cause the game to feel very lop-sided...one level. The game does a good job at wanting more...but never feeling fulfilled.,1,2025-11-29 14:23:12
Played this game for 9 yrs and uninstalled the game. The pay to win is getting way out of hand. This new update really killed it for me. The pass is way to costly. I admit it was worth it for a few months but I stopped after the 4th month. If you wanna have a decent game make sure you use meta decks like everyone else and don't have a original deck you built on your own. Because actually trying to test out different decks and getting stopped by the cycle decks with the hero or 2 heros. Its 🗑 🚮,1,2025-12-07 20:43:16
"I have lost connection on a 5G network at least 10 times during a single match. also i want to mention, the algorithm of matching is not fair at all? this algorithm decides before the match which player to favour with counter cards and does not make it a fair play.

"Extremely Pay-to-Win and Frustrating Clash Royale has completely turned into a pay-to-win game. It constantly pairs you against hard counter decks. It doesn’t matter how well you play—if the system decides you’re supposed to lose, you will. The latest update made everything even worse. Instead of improving balance or gameplay,it pushed the game further into pay-to-win mechanics, basically forcing players to spend money if they want to keep up. What used to be a fun strategy game is now horror.",1,2025-12-08 12:20:10

So 2 opponents who are each 1000 plus points more than me and my partner and towers 2 levels above ours... why is that fun... loss after loss after loss. Wow. Great update. I'll find a better game to play.,1,2019-10-31 00:59:45
"Great game, but it's very flawed. It feels too P2W and a lot of the evolutions are too broken and you have to spend real money to actually have a chance. Matchmaking is also a bit rigged in some instances as you can get matched against much higher level players ( since I'm lvl 15 it's not a big problem). This game is very addictive and fun and it's worth a try.... for the first few arenas... after arena 11 ... it's mega knight haven. Not a problem though, it's pretty easy to counter 😉",1,2023-09-23 04:14:31

It's true that you sometimes face against players with higher leveled cards, but this usually only happens in arena 13+. Still it can be kinda unpleasant.

The seriously long wait time from the time you drop your card to them actually appearing is really ticking me off. This game pissed me off.

Updates have made this game more competitive and less stagnant. Nice.,5,2025-11-24 23:30:34
They should add a surrender option if your teammate leaves in 2v2. Or maybe a report button. Since my last edit in 2019 still no surrender option. Once you hit tower level 10 the game is basically pay to win. Used to love this game but it's honestly just not worth playing at this point. Elixier feels like it takes longer to recharge than it used to. The fact that it's been this long and the game has only gotten worse shows that they don't actually care about the game anymore and just want money.,1,2021-04-16 03:45:59
very fun and also very rage inducing but overall a good game The only bad thing is all the p2w stuff,5,2025-12-02 06:11:03

Removed casual 2s im done. still haven't brought it back years later worst game ever. merge tactics is complete blind luck. I hate this company and the game with all my heart,1,2025-11-23 17:06:45
"Updated review from returning player. This still is the best game of its kind. You can play without spending money, however spending will help you advance a little quicker. The grind can be fun but once you get to higher levels it's less about skills and strategy and really about what deck do you have. Again, fun game, best of its kind but it gets very repetitive at a high level. Not much room for actual strategy",2,2024-09-05 01:17:52
I like the game but there should be a feature to be able to use both ur deck and ur teammates deck if they go offline just so I don't keep losing every round,3,2025-10-29 10:58:04
"DO NOT SPEND $ ON THIS BS! It's 100% rigged & the devs control the game! when they make you lose, they will start making your cards go crazy. for example, I will randomly no longer have control of my cards and they will start to throw the cards at random spots throughout the arena including activating the king Tower which forces you to exit the game and come back. by that point, you will have lost. they do this because they don't want you to play too often and keep receiving rewards. BS!",1,2025-12-21 02:31:50
"While the core gameplay is polished and solid, the devs haven't touched anything outside the store in 6 years. Unless you're alright with blatant pay to win mechanics, dont play this. Even if you've been playing for 7 years, you CAN NOT compete with others' wallets. Remove mega knight from the game. Edit:it's now been 8 years, I tried to get back into the game and it's impossible unless you are willing to spend 12 to 24 dollars on evos that probably won't be relevant in a month.",1,2025-08-19 16:25:43

"Horrible game. Came back after not playing for a while just to be absolutely constantly destroyed because other person always had higher level troops. No matter what strategy I tried, what videos I watched and what I did about it I always lost. I even let someone who is much higher trophies than me play with my available cards and they still lost every battle. Rigged game and matchmaking is horrible. Uninstall.",1,2022-02-08 22:14:18

"It's a fun and addicting game. I would give it more stars but I feel like it's not there with the matchmaking. You will constantly battle someone higher than you which can be very frustrating. I'm level 12 now so have put many hours into the game, but I will forever go against level 13, which doesn't sound bad being 1 higher, but in a game like this it is everything. They need to rework the matchmaking a bit, but other than that it's fun to play.",3,2020-11-18 15:40:59
"This game has been broken for a while now and I've played it since it first came out. There no strategy to this game anymore. The Mega Knight is such an overpowered card that everyone who doesn't have any strategy plays it. Matchmaking is ridiculous. I haven't played someone my own level in a month. Even during the clan war portions of the game I'm always playing someone above me. If you want to be frustrated all the time, then this is the game for you.",1,2022-08-21 18:51:38
"Game is no longer fun, cards that actually need balancing are ignored, game feels more pay to win. Update are either way to far from the next one or don't actually end up adding anything fun to the game. New champions are okay, gold is always empty no matter how much they add ""new"" ways to get more. I don't know if any of the original developers are still working on this game. But as far as it seems the new one lack any of the original's passion and are doing the minimum amount of work.",1,2023-01-14 12:26:12
As bad as can be. Just like every other game now it's on a battle pass type system and is loaded with as many micro transactions as you can imagine. If you plan on doing good don't because Ranking is totally broken and will only ever be placed with matched people 10 percent of the time. Not worth the frustration play a different game.

"game has got stupid over the years. more money for less. it's not about skill until you get all leveled up it's about spending money to do that. And there is nothing random, like the boxes all 4 and 5 star boxes I get gold, kinda defeats the purpose of playing. then all you people who spend money before reading reviews like myself. learn the hard way it's about the money, not the game. supercell has gotten so f- ing greedy.",1,2025-04-24 19:40:46

Strategy was key until they decided to kill the game with unnecessary seasonal free-upgrade for certain characters; completely defeating the concept of years of efforts you put-in for upgrading those very characters.

"still at its core an incredible game with great gameplay loop and replayability. Unfortunately, the past few years have shown supercell to be money-hungry and uncaring of the player experience. the free-to-play grind to own even a single playable deck is now pretty much impossible, and Evolutions have damaged the core gameplay to what is probably an irreparable amount.

"It's an ok game flew through 5k trophies, but at arena 15, I would win 3 then lose 2, and so far it is almost staying in the same rhythm. There is no doubt that the game is rigged.

Because I started to notice when I bought the pass, I was getting easier matches, but now I get countered every 2 to 3 matches every time I win 1 to 3 times.",1,2022-12-24 10:28:53
"With the last update the game has pratically been ruined, pass royale might as well changed the name to battle pass with an abusurd amount of levels for a casual mobile game.

"I've been playing it since launch. The thing that you need to know is this: everything that Supercell does to the game is to get more money from you.

They leave that go for a while, then rebalance to even the cards out, just in time for the new hot release. Until recently you could play noncompetitive, but they broke that",2,2019-10-06 01:18:31

It was changed to allow up to 4 choices to trade for the requester's card. Only problem is that both players MUST have to have the same tier token. Not liking this addition.

I advise against playing it if you have low self-control.",1,2025-05-31 20:09:44
"Game crashes during a match, and has monetization shoved down your throat, along with an algorithm that pairs you against paying players using decks that counters yours once you get far enough in the game without paying. Gameplay is ok when not crashing, but it's terrible when it crashes, and that's usually almost every game.

"Never play this game unless you have months to waste and enough cash to spend. It's basically a pay2win game which convince u to purchase passes to upgrade & win. Clearly the match making algorithm is trying to limit ur progress even ur a pro player, to keep u logged in the game all day. Highly recommend not to play and spend that time on other games or valuable work like trading, freelancing, etc.cuz this is similar to a drug addiction. Once started then players becomes zombies to supercell.",1,2023-06-24 00:05:55

How can you remove the main form of progression (chests) and the best way for free-to-play players to get evo shards (season shop) and replace it with what is basically a slot machine in lucky drops that you can only get 3 times a day? DO NOT play this game unless you plan on spending a lot money, because you WILL be buried by the players who do.

"It's a good game, don't get me wrong. But the matchmaking is just horrible. It's really hard to play against players 3 levels higher than you, practically impossible because their cards can one shot yours(I've faced this in the leagues after the different arenas). Even though it depends on strategy, levels matter a lot and it just makes experience horrible.",1,2020-10-10 22:12:24
"really disappointed in the little care supercell has for it's clients, they can't respond to reviews and when they do it's a bot that answers you. awesome games but the data costs are way to much so download if you have money to waste but if you don't want to to lose all your mobile data in three minutes than rather skip this games, any supercell games for a matter of fact.

"I love playing this game, I enjoy playing the game but I would like a few things to be changed 1) Level grind to be easier to max level 16 more in passive terms(6 hrs once gets 2 star free chest or lucky drops) 2) merge tactics are a really good edition to the game but give a free champion card at the end of the trophy road and upgrade the badge every time reaching the champion in merge tactics. 3) make it easier to upgrade champions",3,2026-01-13 15:26:54
Everything is good but matchmaking is becoming one of the worst. Everytime I play I get +1 or +2 level towers and against Max cards. Really making hard to play any game mode. Not even same level. Happening for many days. I couldn't stop but have to complain. Please make it competitive but not that will make players abandon game. Whatever strategy I apply i will lose if I get higher level towers with Max decks. Please make something worthwhile so that I again make it 5 stars. Good for beginners.,1,2022-07-29 01:37:54

"16 June 2016 : You were clashing mid way and suddenly the screen froze and resumed like 30 seconds later. Time enough for your opponent to launch their attack while you're idle. Frustrating that is.

Anyways, I tried defending myself in the game but the other player was spamming. I think this is rubbish. It cannot happen again. I lost trophies. It is quite unfair.

The game is well put together and fun at first. But the CONS of the game are the matchmaking....after a certain amount of time spent in the game you'll start to experience an unfair advantage. (For example) when I place down a level 10 prince it should be able to outplay the dark prince? Well sadly not when the card is 2-3 levels higher than you. Look at every other similar complaint. I can place 3 skeletons to outplay a level 8 knight. fix your match making and add a penalty when people rq.,2,2021-11-24 17:30:09

With the recent update, this game has simple become another ""pay to win"" app. It's frustrating and sucks the fun out of the entire experience. It's sad to see honestly. Supercell has proven to have sold out to the mass consumers who are willing to spend money to achieve the higher levels of gameplay vs. earning it through the parameters of the game design.",1,2021-12-23 05:32:21

Sure this is aided by spending money but if you are good enough you can counter it and if you can't just stop, breathe, and learn how to play better or just stop. If you think that the game is made for you to lose remember there are real people beating you and if you were curious I have got to Legendary Arena free to play.",5,2025-04-11 07:02:47
"Kids, don't waste your time in these pay to win games. I myself played this game for more than 4 years, and just like most of the game developers, supercell is also greedy. They purposefully match your opponent with stronger players, so that you feel frustrated into buying stuff and those who pay for it feel powerful over weaker opponents. Spending more time in real life is a little bit difficult but far more entertaining than any game or VR. Iam from Pakistan and this is my overview.",1,2022-03-02 02:29:35

"Initially the game was fairly fun, but they keep updating it in a clear cash grab. Had to update my review as they seem to keep making it less appealing. The match up algorithm is still garbage as even if you are a low level you are matched with players that rank 7500+. What's funny is even they admit a very small community wanted to add higher levels but they just couldn't leave that opportunity to make some more money. Play if you want, just dont spend money on it.",1,2023-06-23 05:38:42
"Loved playing this game as a kid back in 2013 , been playing it for a while. Extremely Extremely disappointed to see that SUPERCELL out of all game devs making their CR pay to win. There is no way to progress up the ladder without paying ,you can clearly see it when you reach around 5000 trophies. Won't even recommend Clash Royale to anyone again.",1,2024-01-28 00:54:20

I played back when there was paying to join a battle and losing then wasnt a problem for me cause getting zero coins is funny.

You are constantly playing against higher level players that are way out of your league, the elixir build up is faster for your opponent were they can play 3 cards while you can only play 1.

Their levels are even way more higher than mine, didnt expect this to be a fair game in 1v1. Because they actually would win every round if they would battle everyone with the level lower than theirs. Other than that, sometimes I would get bad or low cards after playing the game for HOURS! Very unfair and terrible.",1,2020-11-18 11:55:16

Coming back to try the game out after multiple years of not playing honestly hurts to see.. it use to be fun and the Pay to Win was still annoying but it had become a major problem that last year or two. Hero cards and evolutions that you can literally just buy for like 20 dollars and then you become very powerful just because you decided to unlock a card you cant get until you are 3 arenas ahead of where you are is kinda insulting for how much time you had to put into the game to be FtP,2,2025-05-07 12:59:29

Game wouldn't load and when it did load I would always lag out. I play other games on consoles with no problems with wifi. But this game lags me out in the middle of battles and doesnt load half of the time. This game has so many problems with the chests I was a level 4 and didnt have a prince into the 2nd arena while all of my opponents had leveled up princes.

"I once rated this five stars. In the year since I rated this, they have completely gutted the progression system. The royale pass has had its rewards reduced by 50%, and there are no more victory chests or season shop. If you want to max out a single card out of 120+, it will easily take you months of work. Unless, of course, you pay ridiculous amounts of money for resources and evolutions. What a downfall.",1,2025-04-14 08:05:46
"If you play this game do not spend real money on it. After years of buying wild cards to max out all of my cards to lvl 15, the developers decided with the last update to downgrade about half of my lvl 15 cards back to lvl 14.

Awful. The game is completely ruined by in app purchases and the leveling scale is off by so much.

Obviously the metas (same 6-7 decks that everyone uses, because if you try to use a homemade deck, your screwed) are annoying but I'm not sure there's anything the developers can do about it. I did take a homemade deck all the way to 6550, but still the most frustrating game I have yet to play. It's obvious there's an algorithm that starts to put you against hard counters after winning so many in a row. Its very annoying, take it out sup",3,2022-02-13 07:59:54

Also the clock thing needs to improve because I'll be deploying a skeleton army and it just Goes. So should only be able to see or even hit in till the time has completed to deploy it to max.

This game has potential to be incredibly fun and balanced. The developers keep introducing new units that break the meta of the game literally making it unplayable unless you spend money. I started this game when it was first released many years ago and took a break until recently. A lot has been added and some cards have been balanced since then. Yet they introduce new legendary cards that are extremely overpowered. Keeping this game balanced is not in the best interest of the developers. Fail,3,2020-07-07 16:36:11

"Meta of the game makes me want to bang my head on a brick wall until I break through the other side, but the other side is nothing but razor wire and broken glass. Get one tower, turtle for the rest of the game and you win, it's not fun, it's repetitive and every game feels the as the last. You can easily get rid of the meta by giving an actual reward for 3 crowning someone, and don't say your reward is 3 crowns because no one cares about crowns for 23 hours of the day. The only real fun is draft mode but even then you get bent over if the game wants you to choose 4 spells while the other guy gets to pick all the units. Doubles is fun too but they reduce how much elixer you get so the game crawls by at a snail's pace or your team mate leaves and it is then impossable to to win. I want to like this game but every time I play it is just the same, everyone does the same dominant strategy, and if you use a deck to counter the turtle then you loose to everything else. I regret every purchase I made on this game and if I had a time machine with one use, I would rather stop me from downloading this game than stopping 9/11",1,2018-09-24 11:55:41
The gameplay is fun.The characters are interesting.But there are still many problems to fix. One problem i face is that i am put against higher lvl players with much better cards.But the game sees that they have the same trophies as me so they must be equal.This means i will have to face better players above my level. Another problem is that the upgrade are way too expensive. Also there is a need for more achievements.,4,2018-10-18 20:30:07
"There's no skill involved, u always get to a certain point where u need to play more in order to get better cards.

If we had a option to rematch the opponent under 1v1 battle. 2. There is no close/end match once we enter 1v1 battle, we always have to close the app and start again 3.

If it's not that, you get spell spammers for the entire game, and so much more. Also, there is no way to report a player, so people have free reign in making the game frustrating and unplayable. Avoid!!!",2,2020-05-22 14:51:22
"I have been playing the game since the first day of release and I can say the game has had its ups and downs. A few times updates has allowed for more enjoyment of the game like ladder play, but now I'm being forced to pay to play, forced to play draft mode and now forced to pay to get the 30 chests from crown tiers which has been free since release. Players who haven't maxed all there cards are now being beaten down and forced to pay up. Supercell you have turned this game into a cash grab. 🖕",1,2023-04-05 05:54:36
"Ever since I did optional update after October 19 update, it never loaded beyond 50%, crashes Everytime. Before optional update it lagged too much, slow loading had been the issue. I've not been able to open game for last 3 days. I don't know why developers don't test rigorously before getting update live. I think it had been blessing in the disguise. This may enable me to delete this game now.",1,2019-10-11 21:31:23
"The game overall is fine.... There's some issues with the server connection I believe.... My gameplay in menu is fine.... But every time for the 3 days I've started a match, the game lags for about 10-15secs... Causing my tower to be destroyed even before I make move. Please look into this and if I'm the only one....

A game with very bad matchmaking and a very unfair battle when you are Level 30 player with Level 11 Tower but have to battle with Level 40 player with 13 Tower :/,1,2025-09-21 04:20:01
"This game is really fun and it's a clear no brainers to see why for most. My one issue is the matchmaking choices I understand you get paired with someone in the same arena as you, problem is Its almost impossible to win against a level 12 king and cards with level 10 king and cards. I honestly wouldn't mind if it wasn't for the fact most of the people reach that level by purchasing chest which gives them cards which gives exp. It's a basic reward system for those who purchase chest.",4,2019-10-01 06:23:23
"It's addictive for the wrong reasons. The fun characters and mass destruction of towers and enemies pull you in until you progress too far in a short amount of time. At this point, you realize the progression is ridiculous and tedious. If you are a new player, don't even try playing now. It was fun when the game first came out, but year after year, the game digs itself into a hole, losing amounts of players. I guess that's what happens to games that become ancient over time. 🤷",2,2025-05-24 05:08:30
"Clash Royale is simply unfair. It pairs you with stronger opponents but around the same crown level. In the beginning, it's like you are winning, but then after not more than 2-3 matches, you face opponents which you can't win. I have been playing this game for very very long, and at Challenger 2. Can't get further due to this. The lag as well. Can't believe Supercell is not doing anything about this. So many critical reviews but Supercell does not bother. This is even in 2v2. Unbelievable.",1,2019-12-16 20:15:07

Waited AGES for an update only to get the clan wars 2 update which has been a major disappointment. The update just dropped, but you can already tell there are a ton of things that rolled out broken. This is going to push a lot of players out of the game. So frustrated with the lackluster content for so long after the game started off so well.",1,2020-09-02 10:34:16

"I gave my first five-star review to Clash Royale about 5 years ago. Since the game was when someone was free to play, it was fun and balanced at least in the lower part of the ladder. But after the introduction of eveloitions the game has become almost un playable if you don't spend money. Don't get me started on tower trops.

"When everything is working as it should, the game can be fun and is a decent time passer; however, even with flagship phones and fast, reliable internet connections, you WILL lag randomly. Supercell has done nothing to address this. You are not compensated for their faults. The servers and balancing algorithms need a LOT of improvement. This game relies on fast reactions, and because of TERRIBLE servers, is not worth the effort to grind your way up the ladder.",3,2022-06-27 18:36:34

"The game has no meaningful mode of communication. You're stuck with a series of paid emojis that can only be used to be toxic. If you do play a match against someone who isn't a dick, you can't try and add them as a friend after. I quit for years and was talked into coming back but 2 months reminded me how awful the player base is.

Really bad support team in my experience. I had my account locked and each agent I tried to contact ended up saying they couldn't do anything about it and ended the conversation without ever answering my questions. It would also take over 30 minutes to receive a response. For weeks my account has been locked with little to no information.

Was fun and enjoyable strategy game. But heavily dependent on cards for having an advantage. I keep on getting matched with level 12s or 13s with high level cards. At that level it's not a match of skill or fair. The only way to level up is to Shell out money or play constantly in clan battles and everything else.

I use to love this game and played it every single day but now it's just now fun anymore. The matchmaking is horrible and its hard to upgrade cards. All I go against is people with no skill and they still beat me because they have higher level cards or they're using decks that requires no skill at all. This game is practically made to make you lose. Once you go on a winning streak and you're trophy pushing it'll start putting you up against high level players and then you go on a losing streak.,1,2020-04-19 08:37:52

Whenever Im in the middle of a battle, the game shuts off and i have to restart and hope it reconnects me quick enough to still have a chance in winning it, something that never happens. Its frustrating to be in the middle of a battle and then it shuts off and I end up losing the battle and trophies for no fault of my own. This is the only app I have that shuts off like this.",1,2019-06-02 10:38:37
I've been playing Clash Royal for almost 8 years now. It's always been a pay to win game. Adding level 15 and evolution at the same time was a terrible idea. Us free to play players are left in the dust. Took me years to level up one deck to max. Now I gotta play for years again to max my deck.... MONEY HUNGRY MUCH!

"Great game but the devs use shady mechanics if you do something they don't like. Like if you have skill but no money or climb in rank too fast they start to do things like lag your drop time, drop a troop you didn't select, drop them in the wrong place, won't spawn critical counter attacker cards when you need them and many more. If you enjoy a true strategy game this is not the game for you. Sorry",1,2020-07-22 04:51:13

Something different to other mobile games at the time and even with all the knockoffs that came out it was still the best version.

It used to be so much fun but after clan wars 2 it went downhill so fast. The level 14 update was the final nail in the coffin as top ladder players were forced to pay money and max out decks immediately after the update to stay on even ground and stay relevant. It's truly unfortunate what's become of this game.",2,2021-12-11 23:02:32
"I'm sad to say I finally have to change my review from a 5 star to a 2 star. This game WAS great, and brought me so many good times and so many rage spells. But at the end of the day it's all pay to win and a cash grab. And recently with every new update the game gets worse. The lastest update is what got me to finally delete the game after 4 years, level 16's.

I lose because of my deck level if so low somehow the enemy I faught have higher level that my deck. So I think this game is pay to win because if you top up you can get more level to level your deck and your tower .

I've enjoyed and spent time on this game, and not just time, I've spent a good $500 In my lifetime. It's no longer worth it.

Every update they do makes the game significantly worst.

"This game is just purely pay 2 win and just not worth playing. I played this game back when it was starting to become famous and seeing the popularity turn the developers greedy for money, ruined the game. Once you climb up the ranks, the game will literally become impossible to win, without spending money. The cards are also super unbalanced, with new cards being most of the time op and if you start going on a winning streak, the game will put you agaisnt decks that counter your deck.",1,2021-02-01 01:42:26

Yes, skills can't be paid but the cards are and so you will still lose to a player that doesn't have the skills to really win.

Cards are Imbalance, the developers are super greedy now. They it's about progression but it isn't. I would have preferred to give it a 0 star but I can't. They keep introducing new cards which in return makes the game more bad. I feel now that I literally wasted my time on this game. Instead go and play coc or boom beach that's far better.

Been playing for years and sank countless dollars into this game on battle passes only. But wow have they screwed it up. It's completely pay to win now and I'm also pretty sure most of the upper players hack. I count elixir pretty well and people drop at a 50 percent faster than you at all times. They will drop a 7 or 8 cost card then have a 3 and 5 played a few seconds later. So @#$% I'm out.,1,2024-02-11 07:44:42
"New update adding level 16 and heroic cards while removing a variety of ways to level up cards really shows Supercell is looking for more ways to make money.

Progress in the game is heavily dependent upon whether you pay to play and limited for those that play for free. What used to be fun has become tedious and frustrating.

It's a fun game but it's not balanced at all. The ranking is determined by trophies. Meaning if higher player with cards you don't have are on a losing streak you will face them and they'll have the advantage to defeat all your cards. Then it's p2w. You have will face enemies that have higher card leveling than you because they put money into the game. It's impossible to beat enemies who can literally delete anything you put out because they payed for chest to get levels for their characters.,1,2024-04-21 04:03:29

Same old grind... People with time and money can level up to 14 (new). Short cycle decks work best (2.6) and you don't have to spend money on legendary. They change cards at random after you spend months working on leveling up to have it reduced. The game is unfairly balanced and they are slow to make the game new and they lack creativity.,1,2021-12-31 20:13:50
"I've been playing since launch, and this is the worst the game has ever been by far. Evolutions are such a pay to win mistake and completely disrupt the flow of the game.

And it's happening more then 70%, so you have money then play. It's giving you many times higher players then you and you will always lose the game, edit After 6 years still not changed.

"I love playing this game but I have to give it a 1 star for a couple of reasons. Mostly the pay 2 win, it is absurd. I can understand having micro transactions but when you make it so that every new feature has to be paid for or it takes 6months to collect then you are crossing a line. The other thing is how long it takes to unlock chests or compete in clan wars. It is ridiculous. I wish they'd change this so it would be more fun for everyone and not just the people who have hundreds of dollars",1,2024-12-17 09:15:21

"First time playing in a while (btw started from the beginning again) and it's just pay to win, I get killed by these guys with 0 trophies and 5 Epics that are like level 10, because they bought like 30 dollars worth of gems, but you only need to buy like 5 or 10 dollars of gems, but once you get very far in (like 3 or 2 weeks of good amount of playtime) it's not as bad, but the thing is you won't be able to level up because of the mad gem spenders.",1,2021-05-31 09:00:04

"The game gets fairly boring after a while, not going to lie. The gameplay is based around your cards, but pay-to-win players have a significant advantage over everyone else because they can get much better and more powerful cards faster than free players can which makes it rather annoying trying to battle overleveled players in lower arenas.

"I want to get one thing straight. This game, for the most part really fun. But it has some huge issues with its clan wars. And instead of fixing these problems, they made it to where you can get more rewards for putting up with them. The problem is the fact that most of the clan war matches can't even be faught with your own custom made deck. You have to use random preset decks that can have huge weaknesses to your opponent's.

It seems like the game just keeps pairing me up against people with cards mutliple levels hire than mine. I have mostly level 10 cards, which take forever to level up, and I am getting paired up against all level 14",1,2023-05-27 23:35:37

Sure it feels great to win when I do, but far more often I am overwhelmed with multiple high level legendary cards.

Adding Level 16 only benefits players who already have maxed-out cards while offering no real help to others. Instead of improving the balance, the update has made the game feel even more unfair.If the developers continue in this direction, the game will eventually turn into a pure pay-to-win system, which is disappointing for long-time players.

I could go on, but have a 500 char limit. One the negative side though - all the recent reviews about supercell losing the plot/money-grab etc - they are 100% right.

"I played this game for a while when it first came out and it was fun, challenging, and the cute graphics were a plus. I picked it up again recently and was surprised by how much the gameplay experience had changed. I was constantly being matched against players I had no chance of winning against. For a while I wondered if it was my strategy. But reading other reviews made me realize that this game is for paying players. Sadly, I won't be playing anymore.",1,2018-11-03 12:08:23
"Changed my 5 star review from over a year ago due to the most recent changes to the game. As for these changes, wow, I can't remember the last time I've seen developers remove so many features in one single update. 2v2s went from being the most fun part of the game to completely meaningless and difficult to navigate to from the home screen, prices in the shop seem to have gone up dramatically from last year (this was blamed on inflation, but doing the math on champion card shows a 20000% increas",1,2023-03-30 18:15:40

"I came back to this game after about 7 years of not playing it, and it is so p2w now. This game very obviously favors people who spend a lot of money on it. The new heroes are a good example of how you could either wait a very long time to get one for free, or you could spend 12 bucks and get it now. The people who spend that money will most likely have the upper hand in most arenas. Not really fair. This game isn't worth playing for a long time if you don't want to spend a lot of money on it.",2,2025-12-13 06:27:56
"The game was a good game but due to their recent changes I can confirm the game is now Pay to Win. They have put the new cards and levels behind massive level walls and money now unlocks them. If you want to start playing this game, just dont unless you have the best card in the game.... the credit card!! Now they will give you the new cards one at a time for £12 a month - netflix does not even charge that much - they have lost all sense of value and want to get as much $ as they can now shame!",1,2023-07-08 22:11:13
"The graphics and art are well made and definitely give off the ""Clash of Clans"" vibe, a straight upgrade from its predecessor But the actual gameplay isnt that great. The game also suffers from ""meta"" cards that punish you for not using them. The chest and levelling system makes this game a ""Freemium"" game, and it's getting worse in that regard. Too much emphasis on grinding, as that is the only way to deal with p2w players, and the grinding takes too much time for it to be worth playing.",2,2022-09-21 18:19:50
"I’ve been playing Clash Royale for over a year now, and it’s pretty addictive. The strategic gameplay is awesome, but the grind to level up your cards can be a bit much. Matchmaking can be frustrating too, especially when you’re up against higher-leveled players. But, once you start mastering your deck, the game is really fun. Tip: focus on upgrading a few cards instead of trying to max them all!",4,2025-05-04 19:19:44
"The matchmaking is built in a way to frustate lower level players. At certain point you will face opponents with higher levels and they end up winning the games despite the bad plays they make. Clan wars works the same way. So, after all isn't a matter of skill but who has the higher level. It takes a long time to get high level and I rather pay 20/30€ for a full PC game experience with no micro transactions than a couple of gems that will grant me a couple cards.

What bullcrap. The last 5 battles have been at least over twice my trophies and they have troops that I haven't even been able to unlock yet plus evolutions.

Now you have to get all those cards back AGAIN to upgrade it to level 15, to which you'll have to do it once more to reach the new max card level. Again. Absolutely the worst update to experience and I am now very uninterested in this game.",1,2025-11-29 06:35:38
"Good, fun game. It has it's pitfalls of needing to play meta and only meta when climbing ladder, being too defensive for a very offensive designed game and whatever, but it's an all-round very fun game. The only couple issues come with the lack of attention some cards get to the point they're unused in the majority of decks, and the entire f2p situation with increasing level caps and evolving cards.

"This is my first time writing a review for a game. Felt like it is necessary now... I've been playing this game since it came out. The last update is mind-blowingly garbage. To make this already pay-to-win game even more infuriating, they give card upgrades to only 6 cards making deck building extremely limited and do that in a very unhealthy state of the meta. 🤦 I find it concerning that they try so hard to add real money-based card unbalancing in addition to leveling at the detriment of gp.",1,2023-06-30 01:36:31

"Has become increasingly pay 2 win, and to be able to move to other arenas, you're often forced to have your cards at high levels. That's because you are often matched against players with cards that are 1-2 levels higher (I'm for the record at around 5500 trophies with lvl 11 cards).

Disappointed in the gm and its current course. I've been playing since it came out and it has become more and more pay to play. No one uses a high elixir deck purposely to spam elixir over and over on their opponents which was never the case before. Using a deck 4.0 or more is completely suicide now. If you don't play the same as your current opponents you simply lose more than you win and where's the fun in that.

And some way you could quit if it continues for a couple minutes.",3,2019-07-04 21:20:14

"This game was good back then but now this game become the worst unballanced and pay to win game ever im playing this game for 9 years and its sad to see the game going this way im stuck in 9k cup and everyone i play with %100 using mega knight, pekka, and elite barbarians in their deck if i need to play those cards to continue im refusing to play back then we were making our own decks now everyone using ""meta"" decks and also evos were a bad choice to add to the game they are brokenly op",1,2025-09-05 12:35:31
It's pretty bad with the algorithm. The game is actually good except for the match algorithm. The game tends to set your opponents up with ever counter. 3+ wins is very rare. Then also the overmatched in various card. Basically. Everyone plays the same deck. Because that is what they see on YouTube. Actually no balance in the card set up. You can max out ever card. But lose because the set up that nearly everyone has will trump you. Call it the deck of the month.,2,2023-01-28 07:11:54
this game is so fun but there are some parts where u get frustrated,4,2025-12-26 21:28:16
"game is extremely pay to win. Don't bother unless you want too spend $$$'s catching up to other players. They release overpowered evolutions every month that you can unlock either through 6 months of grinding or 5 seconds of using your credit card. But it gets nerfed a month after, so make sure you buy it right away to use it while it's broken!! Card levels also make the game frustrating. Good luck playing against people 3+ levels ahead, even when they play skillessly",1,2024-05-15 23:16:16

used to be fun played for 8 years now the game is pay to win and supercell has gotten greedy now the game is ruined,1,2025-12-18 23:04:07
Definitely a pay-to-win game. Been playing since a month after release and still nowhere near the cards levels expected from putting so much time into a game. Rewards are puny and upgrades are ridiculously expensive. Still a very addictive and fun game but could do with a serious balance on a reward to effort basis. Takes a lot of the fun out for people who aren't prepared to spend hundreds of pounds a month on a game!,3,2018-12-05 21:05:18
"At the beginning the game is great, but as you move ahead it will get pretty much harder to win. In order to stay equally in the game with the other players you must increase the cards vitality buying coins and gems. The fight matching concept in the fights is a mess, tower strength compare with the others is ridiculous. Some players insult you if you are in a clan, with no fundaments. The screening of the supercell with this guy's is poor. Some players have some kind of hack with the elixir.",2,2022-06-02 22:38:30

"I've been playing Clash Royale for years. I generally like it. One issue I take is the matching algorithm. It's based on trophy count, which is fine, but it doesn't account for tower level or card levels. It can be really frustrating, especially when seasons start. Otherwise a great game,and truly playable as free-to-play. Never a requirement to pay for upgrades or watch ads. Edit: Pay to upgrade players at the higher levels makes the game extremely frustrating.",3,2021-04-26 01:12:39

I've played a handful of 2v2s then clicked battle for another one straight away, but since it's not the default I go straight into s 1v1. Not a user friendly interface anymore.

I've been defeated.. A few friends have uninstalled it for the same reason. 🙏🏻",3,2022-06-27 19:10:34
The game experience was awesome but Supercell is useless. I played it for 7 years and yesterday my account got stolen and all I get is automated responses from Supercell. I lost 7 years of my time because Supercell who runs the game can't care less. I wouldn't advise anyone to play this game for extended periods and invest money or time in it. If it gets stolen then Supercell won't help you get it back.,1,2024-08-29 14:35:00
"It a normal game where either someone enjoys it alot or doesn't, it's not fair in most situations but that makes it challenging sometimes and other times you can't really defeat your opponent because they're two or three levels higher than you which in the upper tiers is alot of difference in ability and cards, altogether play it at your own risk because you'll get tilted or even rage at some point but still play for the fun of it not for anything else ^^",3,2019-08-14 06:05:06

this game has worst loading it's loading is very long it frustrated me please do something better 🙏🏼😭,1,2026-01-22 03:26:26
"This is the most unbalance game I have ever played. Players who are paying for it are getting huge advantage their elixir growth is 2 times faster than normal players and also they need to face less levelup player than themselves. On the other hand it seems like they are letting paid players win. So in my opinion if you don't have money to pay don't even download this game but if you have a lot of money please spend on it, I ensure you that you won't loss even a single match.",1,2024-04-05 23:44:43
"Clash Royale is one of the best games that you can play on mobile, having tons of different strategies to learn and master, but the development team behind it seems to hate the game and anyone who plays it. This is most evident in the April 2025 update, where they made progressing through the game take twice as long and removed dozens of useful features. This game has meant something to me, and hundreds of others for more the 9 years now, but I can't bear to play it anymore. Goodbye CR",1,2025-04-13 04:47:25
"A month ago I would have rated this 5 star.... Now.. I dont know how to rate it. Ever since one of the most recent updates this game has started to have major issues. It is very glitchy, large lag times, and automatically closes on my devices at random times (usually in the middle of battle). I am not sure what the developers did... But I am on the verge of deleting this and never opening another supercell app again. It is VERY frustrating!",2,2019-11-05 20:48:01
"Pay to win. Clash Royale was amazing when it first launched and portrayed a novel concept of the deck-builder and strategy genre. But nowadays it's almost as if the game can detect whether I make purchases or not and tailors my gameplay experience. If I've recently bought gems, I seem to win much more often and get better matchmaking. If it's been a while, I tend to go on losing streaks and get matched with decks that completely counter mine.",1,2023-08-25 00:12:10
"Unsustainable game. The longer you play, the more at a disadvantage you are if you don't pay. I have paid to play a couple times, so if you don't pay at all there is no way you can attain legendaries or even epics at a high enough level to compete in ladder. Still the same issue in 2022. I'm level 11 with level 11 cards and I get matched with same level players with level 13 and level 14 cards",1,2022-08-17 15:34:41
"Quitting this game after the newest update. They doubled the price for passes but removed the best game progression items magic coins and book of books. Less gold and magic items and they are adding a level 15? They also made it so that my favorite 2v2 mode will not count towards progressing through the pass, and it takes about 20 minutes to match to one game vs a few seconds before???",1,2023-03-27 22:00:07
This Game is really good aftet play Clash of Royayle for 8 hours. can't stop play I also remember when I was kid play all night and day and still grow up now am 15 years old still love this game I wish this game don't leave thx u for Best time of my life ❤️😊,5,2025-11-20 13:05:44
"Look quick and simple, you have a great game ngl, but here's the thing, matchmaking is the real major problem, idk why but I'm a level 10 and I'm getting pared with level 11 and 12s. This might seem normal, you get a level 12 or 13 now or then, but this is a recurring thing for me, The lowest leveled player I have faced is a level 11, there's a catch, he has level 12 or higher cards and I have leveled 10-11 cards. All I want is for you guys to hear me out, and fix matchmaking. Thank you.",1,2020-10-17 21:01:37
Developers don't even play their game. every update makes the game worse. it's all pay to win garbage.,1,2025-12-08 13:51:18
was a great game until they updated the trade system. now it just makes me want to blow my brains out in chat as there are 5000 trade offers available. stupid if you ask me and others.. gameplay is easy to use and good. game is just becoming to micro transaction based rather than play... as most if these types of games do before they die.,3,2018-12-18 17:44:43
"Startef playing this about 3 days after release, 6 or 7nyears back now, it was by a long way the best game on the market, but now, now its little more than a capitalistic wet dream of a game, pay to play at its very peak, taken all the decent game modes out and just ruined the game over the last 2 years. And now its just a race on who can spend the most money. Don't waste your time on this admittingly once great game. Supercell sold out and ruined their games too.",1,2023-05-01 16:37:27
"had a good review that's been up for years, started the game when it was new and on/off for years. coming back to it and seeing basically everything behind a paywall to get anything, removing chests, removing the mini games and banner boxes makes this game unplayable unless you enjoy spending money on a game on your phone. It was fun while it lasted but these last updates will kill the OG crowd and make it harder for new players so even want to try.",1,2025-06-26 03:40:56
"I've been playing this game since it almost first came out on Android. but it's sad to see that this game is starting to become pay to win. I'm in Challenger I and I constantly lose two people that I've just super high levels (not even King tower just high level cards). But on top of all this, the matchmaking is insanity. You win 1 game easy, game 2 is hard, but possible, then game 3 someone completely counters your deck. Please Supercell, fix the game I've loved for 3+ years.",2,2019-11-13 17:40:14
"No ads, lots of creativity with deck building. They just removed wild cards from the season shop, making it even harder for people who don't spend money to progress. I could spend a bunch of time getting the cards in my deck leveled up, or I could spend some money and get the same result. I also get matched up with players with highly overleveled decks, making it feel like all of their cards absorb all damage.",2,2024-08-30 23:02:06
"Although paid players are privileged than free players, Supercell indeed has taken lots of step to ensure that free players can excel as well. Especially every month, the wild shard and book of cards can be bought from the shop that helps to maximize card levels. Plus, the daily free gifts, and crown gifts as well. Those who lack skills, are crying in the corner and bragging, and you can play it on pc as well, it runs well, unless you have a potato pc.",4,2024-11-08 11:32:26
"As far as I can tell, it's a very annoying game. I started the game from scratch and there are so many sweaty players in the beginning that it's hard to even win. I'd be losing more trophies than I gain if I had any. They should add a feature to have a like a AI bot at certain difficulties to help the player improve and get better.",1,2021-11-25 10:13:01
The game is crashing every time.,1,2025-11-30 20:28:25

"Matchmaking is horrendous, matches you up intentionally against better players from time to time to make you lose trophies and convince you to pay. Progression is incredibly slow without using money, I have been playing for over 5 years on the same account and I still haven't reacted the maximum account level. Another cash grabbing game like all the rest of them.",2,2021-11-15 23:29:27
"Been playing for 5 years, I almost maxed in all my cards and there's almost no reason to play anymore. Clan wars was okay when it came out, but it got stale real quick. Supercell missed it with its magic item update which doesn't benefit veterans like me. I seen so many people leave my clan and uninstall the game since its on its way to just disappear. They need to do something quick before the older players just switch to another game.",2,2021-06-01 11:14:32

Would give 0 star if I can. Absolute horrible matchmaking with extremely overleveled opponents. Some cards are too broken eg. Prince while others are in the trash.,1,2025-10-28 21:52:48
"I'm currently facing the worst enemy selection in 1v1 battles. I'm being constantly put against higher tower level opponents & whenever I'm almost at the edge of clearing the arena , I'm being pulled down by these tactics. And the more worst part is the pass royale. Truly a waste of money. You should give some more features to it when you're charging that much of money.",1,2021-02-22 13:19:17
"I don't usually make reviews or give feedback, but this is outrageous!! I redownloaded the game after 2/3 years and some of my already unlocked cards are missing! I lost a mirrol lv.12 with 2 golden upgrades, clone, etc. In short:all cards of the current arena 14 and 15 + some extra. And not only cards, but also titles! The game says that I played the game for 2 years, while the account is 9 years old!",1,2025-06-12 23:56:52
horrible played this game for awhile until this dumb ahh game starts make the worst matchmaking in the world I can make an probably 30 stupid essays about how bad this GG are is playing this game literally selling all you money or time into this game I can't emotionally express how trash this game is they only reason people are good are one out of two reasons 9 years spent on this game in desperation or 1 day of 10000 dollars spent on this game like super cell how greedy can you actually get,1,2025-10-03 10:52:23

"The game used to be good before the team behind it started pushing money grabbing content and making the game almost impossible to progress through without spending some kind of money just to be able to compete with veteran players. Thats coming from a veteran player who's played the game since high school. If I were to start fresh on a completely new account, it'd take astronomical amounts of time and/or money just to make it into the end game. I cant even go into detail bc of character limits",1,2025-05-03 05:27:48
"Very fun game once you finally learn how to play it. I played it off and on for about 2 years, but never had much fun. Recently I started using an actual strategy, rather than some random homemade deck. It takes a while to get good at a deck, but once you do it's pretty fun. I personally use splashyard and I really enjoy it. One main problem is the amount of time it takes to level up cards... getting one level 14 can take a whole month, even with pass royale. But still a solid and fun game.",4,2022-06-26 03:14:11
"this game is one of the most disgusting things that ever happened to humanity. It is pay to win to the point that you can spend thousands of dollars and still not be maxed. You are able to buy cards that are alreary in the game for 60 bucks. Like bruh. You can buy battlefield 6 with that amount of money. The devs are so money hungry that they ignore all player feedbacks, even though their own social media is full of comments telling them to stop ruining the game.",1,2025-11-28 17:05:31
"Great game! I would give it 5 stars but I have been really annoyed lately with the fact that there is no give up button. Recently, I have run into alot of players with characters at least 2 levels over all of my stuff and I just get beat down. And the whole time they are doing it they are posting the crying face or oops comments. I feel that the weak players they are taunting someone with lower stuff is just wrong and I dont want to sit there for anywhere from 1 min to 3 mins. JMO though",4,2019-10-07 09:32:01
"It's diffrent but a good diffrent Edit: I had no idea how to spell different at the time and I have failed in revising it when I changed my rating in 2022. Anyway, this game used to be such a great time, though I lost interest once early 2023 came around due to the game's changes such as adding level 15 and costs of upgrading cards. That coupled together with my interest in another card game coming back, I simply didn't care for the game anymore. I'll probably come back to the game eventually.",4,2024-01-15 06:37:44
"It is a great game. However, the matchmaking system and card leveling system need a redo. I've been playing for 6 years, and over time, I have noticed the difference between card levels got larger and larger to a point where the game has become a lot more annoying to play. If you have higher level cards, it's a massive handicap to the other player. It is very difficult to win if the opponent has a higher level card even if you are skilled.",2,2022-12-12 04:58:45
"Great game and quite engaging but it misleads customers into purchasing their ""gifts"". For example, the game showcased that the player would recive 3x rewards via an in-game tracker. However, when you purchase this, the 3x ""reward"" is the total reward. This is quite deceiving as many players would assume it's the showing the reward X3, which is what they showed in the game. As someone who's played for 6 years, this is quite unfortunate.",1,2023-01-14 18:16:26
"Gamemodes, Events Everything is pay to win it is no fun for anyone who can't pay just to have fun also if a new player downloads the game it's just garbage",1,2025-09-20 16:57:00
"My last review was in 2016. Lots has changed in this game and it's better now. You can grow allot faster as a free2play player. The ladder gives nice stuff when you pay. Still think upgrade costs way too much, also you need too much starpoints to upgrade max lvl cards. Also the extra quests are only for 1v1 which sucks!! Make them just like the others, complete in any game mode.",4,2019-10-17 17:53:02
This game used to be a great game but now it's almost impossible to go to a new arena since they always match up you with people who are more than 2 levels ahead of you which makes impossible to fight since their cards are super leveled up and when you get a fair match up the game freezes and doesn't let you play which makes you almost an auto lose,1,2019-05-29 10:53:31
its great if you struggle at the beginning its because its not meant for you to breeze by its skill based for a reason (for the most part.,5,2025-09-08 04:40:44
Watching this game's downwards progression was tremendous. Used to be a pay to win game and now it's become even more a pay to win game. Ruined every single mechanic the game used to have. I can't even fit whole balance issue of the cards here. There are some cards that are just too powerful and not yet fixed after 2 years. This game used to be really fun but not anymore. The game is literally ruined to crisp. Skill almost non required anymore. Whoever wastes money on the game wins.,1,2021-12-26 08:28:55
"This game is horrible. It's completely pay-to-win and supercell even encourages that mindset. The match ups in the game are horrible. My lvl 10 account is constantly going against lvl 13s and lvl 12s, while my other account (lvl 1) is going against lvl 4s, 5s, 6s, and occasionally lvl 7s. The game's algorithms are absolutely horrible. They need to fix match ups and encourage people who AREN'T pay-to-wins otherwise, I see no point in playing when you can't do what the game wants you to do, push.",1,2019-12-14 08:35:25

"I started playing 4 years ago and The biggest problem is is that it's pay to win, the gap between each level is insane. When you fight someone 2 levels above you it's basically a lose unless the guy is super bad, even if you're really good at the game it doesn't matter. The only thing I would play this game for is the tournaments, which makes the cards only level 9. I've won against people in master 3 and above multiple times even won against someone that was too 5000 in the world in a tourney.",2,2021-02-14 05:31:19

Its sad there isnt another game like it that isnt pay to win. Everything about the game is designed to keep you buying things. The store is constantly updating with new high priced chests for small things. The matchmaking system is designed to make you lose more than you win.",1,2020-04-02 04:57:23
"Imagine spending lots of time and money; money to upgrade a card you like and time learning how best to use it. Coming up with a a deck you like and spending more time on each card. Then, because the game makers introduce some new card that they make overpowered so everyone will use it and spend money upgrading it fast, they cripple/nerf the cards you've taken time and money to improve. That's this game all the time. It's frustrating. They let their desire to make money supercede all.",1,2020-05-11 02:18:06

"Last year the company has been constantly teasing ways to get the most money out of the game, despite how it affects to (all) the players. The last update is the result of that teasing applied to almost every aspect of the game, for the absolute worst. Conciously trying to push addiction into players just for money.

2020 meta is incredibly boring. Huge amount of units available in the game but far too many people using the same few units. It makes for really dull defensive tactics followed usually by Hogrider. Valk is a unit that's meant to be good at crowd control but also holds her own against single target units far too well. Just over Clash Royale at this point. Takes too long to max units and it's just not well balanced at the higher levels. 3 year player and I see why so many 1* reviews lately.,1,2020-02-29 14:43:27

"the balancing in this game seems to be an after thought in the minds of the developers. Clash is a competitive game but card levels are way too impactful in the current meta and certain cards are just not used.

"best multiplayer game ever(old review). This was my review 6 years back but now it changed, they changed it. It's the worst game ever. You wanna win, pay fricking money. The algorithm is rigged to make you pay for the royal pass.

"After playing this for 7 years, the game updates now make the gap between F2P and pay to win obscenely obvious and frustrating. The lag for deployment of troop placement and the extremely slow speed of the game now has made this game unplayable.

The game is actively being ruined. I won't quit playing right now, but don't get this game. Unless something major changes this is getting 1 star.",1,2024-06-26 22:05:07
"It is obvious that supercell cares more about money than making sure their game is running smoothly. Every recent update gets worse and worse.

After 2 years of playing this game, i am just about done with it. If these issues aren't addressed soon, i say boycott Supercell. Good game but going down the drain fast.",2,2018-12-25 02:49:38
The game has a good idea and nice graphics. It loads rly fast and takes shorts amounts of time to play which is great. The down side 8s that if u don't pay it will take u close to a year to max out your deck and when you finally do u are stuck with it... U cant change it cus it will take you the same amount of time to lvl up other cards just yo try them out.... I say try cus at the end you might not even like them...

It is constantly giving problems and kicking you out mid-battle. I installed and uninstalled multiple times thinking it would fix the problem but it just continued and now made it worse. I can't even battle anymore. I hope customer services can be of more help. One last thing, is it necessary to have so many maintenance breaks if nothing is being fixed?",1,2018-12-16 20:57:39
"I dont think you guys are doing this right supercell, something is missing.. Im not able to play the game as it is designed because of the sad leveling process. I am originally able to defend a push wih ease and 2 or so cards but because of such high different card levels, I need to spend MORE elixer than needed if the levels were more similar. The techniques used are not efficient because it is just all shut down with high level cards. Right now, many good players are frustrated that they can't progress cuz of these reasons and if you want people to enjoy ur game and play it as it should be, change something instead of being greedy pigs",2,2018-11-20 08:20:11

In my years of gaming I have never seen a game like this. Everything makes you wanna spend money. Season challenges make you buy the gold pass and normal battle arena is unfair for example you are level 7 and sometimes you can get a max level player (max is 14) as your opponent which makes you wanna spend more money. I'm warning kids to not play it because I know many people who broke Thier phone and bank account for this game. The simple point is that it is unbalanced and don't play this game.,1,2023-12-29 17:02:00

don't waste your time. it's a pay-to-win kind of game you are stuck in a never-ending Loop of never progressing unless you pay real money. this game starts off very fun and it's a very addicting game but it gets to be ridiculous when you run into people who are either the same level as you or lower with less health on their towers but they somehow still manage to beat you using the same cards you have. there have been multiple times that I have played someone who had a seemingly endless deck.,2,2019-01-24 13:29:57

Ive seen awful deck low skill players at 7500 trophies. Which was world record at the time i left the game. Now its all about pay-to-win model.

I really love the game and I hope it wouldn't become another cash grab like one of my favourite games pvz. Introducing 2 new levels in a short timespan is crazy as it serves almost no purpose. We are forced to grind due to overleveled players. The only justification for level 14 is champions and level 15 has nothing new to give. I think this update can be fixed if only you listen to us and do surveys.,1,2023-06-19 19:04:27
It has gone better over time but i still think the matchmaking could use some overall improvement due to lag but it isn't that easy to fix which i understand but if my opponent is able to place a 8 cost card after a 6 cost card then i think its unfair but i do not think it could be a connection issue but a in-game issue but then again i have rarely ran into this sort of problem and the game is still fun just as i remember it.,4,2022-03-08 02:22:40
its a good game once you get to like arena 7+ then it gets fun but if you lose a lot of times you normaly rage and it also very p2w,5,2025-12-02 14:42:20

"The game at it's core is very fun. The problem is in how supercell has chosen to monetise their game. They didn't choose to go into a cosmetic micro purchase like game, but to instead make the game pay to win. The years haven't made this any better since gimmicky evolutions, which are literally impossible to get as a free to play player even with luck. Playing against lvl 14 cards at 5000 trophy's simply makes the game frustrating and dumb. I don't see thing getting any better.",1,2024-04-04 22:12:45
"I'm choosing to giving it two stars instead of one because it was fun for awhile. You get some cards, build a good deck, get your cards built up, start seeing some elites in your deck, it's all fun until it's not. The problem is it's CLEARLY a pay to win game. If you get on a 4-5 game win streak they will put you up against people you have zero chance at beating. Can you guess what stops that misery from continuing? You have to buy something.

I started to notice that to win, you have to play a certain card.

Not bad . Like it.... Had to change my review. It seems like there's some kind of cheat some players spawn out more characters then I could. I didn't even get to hit one of thier castles. It seems more and more each time I play it that some lower level player is destroying me pulling out more cards then usual some even have high card going out 3 at a time.

"Used to give this game 5 stars. I played this game since 2016. The game is fun, which is ruined by the fact that the game is pay to win, having to pay the price of several full priced games or else the progress made from spending money is insignificant. The game is still playable and fun, however, I highly recommend not spending a penny on it.",1,2023-08-07 09:01:44
I think this game is very fun with lots of strategy needed and also the ability for lots of customization. Spme bad things to my knowledge is that the game has many pay to win aspects for example when the super versions of sertaint units like the barbarian where added you could rather grind for a long time or pay money to get them all instantly,3,2023-11-10 03:02:04
fun for a while. winning requires paying every season. the community is fun. the game isn't.,2,2026-02-14 08:35:23
"Introduction: Clash Royale is a real-time strategy game created by Supercell which was globally released on March 2nd, 2016. Clash Royale is a hybrid of 3 core game concepts, collectible card games, tower defense, and multiplayer online battle arena. The game progresses as players compete against each other in isolated battles which give the players rewards for winning and punishments for losing. A way that game rewards the player is by giving them chests (loot boxes) that contain cards that can be unlocked and upgraded the more the player collects them, these cards can be played in-game during battles. The player is also 'rewarded' by receiving trophies, I say rewarded with quotes because this isn't necessarily a reward but a side effect of winning or losing, these trophies are an indicator of the player's skill level and they are matched against players with a similar trophy count . My Opinion: There are many more things to do in Clash Royale, but what I want to focus on is the core matchmaking battles. I first started playing Clash Royale when I was in 7th grade during its initial release, I still have fond memories of the time, I would talk with my friends at school about getting new cards and we would play against each other in friendly battles. After a while, I stopped playing and completely forgot about it for a few years. About 2 Years ago I saw one of my friends playing Clash Royale which made me remember the good times I had had years ago, so I redownloaded the game and started playing it again I was able to quickly rise in the ranks due to the player base getting better and widening the skill gap between lower ranks, this gave me a sense of gratification that hooked me. It's been 2 years since I started playing again and I still play on a daily basis. I do enjoy the grind of matchmaking and the rewarding feeling I get by outplaying my opponents however I do have one big problem with the game, the Freemium aspect of the game. The game is objectively paid to win up to the max level when players max out the levels of the cards and towers. Players with higher-level cards have an advantage over other players with lower levels since their cards can deal more damage and have more health this makes playing at lower levels very frustrating since you can play much better than another player and still lose just because they are a higher level than you. You can upgrade your cards through the aforementioned chests that you get from winning battles but you can also directly buy them from the shop with in-game currency and paid currency. The frustration that players get from losing to players with higher-level cards drives them to buy cards so that they can become better at the game and have a better chance of winning. This aspect makes it so free to play players have a much harder time playing and leveling up compared to players willing to sink cash into buying more cards which in turn gets them more trophies. This aspect is the only part of the game that I really dislike and wish was never added since the game would be much fairer without it. Despite this feature I will still continue to play the game until I reach a point at which I am at the top 1% of the player base then I will quit and never play again. Conclusion: The game is fun and addicting so if you know you have an addictive personality I wouldn't recommend this game to you, but If you are looking for a fun strategy game that you can play with friends and expand your deck over time, I would recommend this game since I can't find anything better than it. Overall, I'd give this game a 7/10 since I feel like I've learned so much from it and still have a fun time playing it, but the Pay to Win aspect stops me from giving it a better score.",4,2021-01-23 04:31:05
"Been playing for years hard to advance to the top but good game and time killer very addicting you'll need to spend money to advance quicker, 2022 now and it's sad that you have to spend so much money and still can't be on top...

"Please understand that this game is not pay to win. It may seem like it at first but the developers have given us ways to level up faster and unlock more cards quicker. The game does however take a lot of practice for one to clime up the ranks. I've been playing this game for 4 years and it annoys me to see people claiming the game is ""pay to win"". The game is based on skill and people that don't have the time or patience to understand the game assume its because of their cards.",4,2021-11-01 19:43:56
Excellent game until you are very good without paid upgrades ..then all of the sudden you get the signal disconnection for a few seconds with full on WiFi or 4G.

"this game became trash as soon as level 15, this game is so pay 2 win even if you add more feature to help free 2 play, this game is goddamn scripted it's not funny",1,2025-11-22 15:46:57
"i used to play the game all the time. then it started crashing every time i tried to battle. by the time i loaded back in, my opponent already won. this caused me to lose teophies, so i uninstalled. i come back months later because my brother said the crashing was fixed, but lo and behold ot still crashes. i am very annpyed by this, because i can not get any more trophies. i hope this gets fixed soon",2,2019-05-20 07:08:22
This game is a 67/10. They made the game so good by adding level 16 and heroes. It's so fun that I made a hole in my wall and started screaming the N word. Though 1 thing that can be better is the data. It already takes up as much data as where if I delete everything that takes storage I still can't download it so let's go ahead and up it so it takes up 5GB so less people can play the game. also to make it the perfect game let's buff witch ice spirit and mega Knight so I can have more fun.,5,2026-01-14 09:03:46
so this game if offline but it takes a long time to load it but it is a very good game,5,2025-12-15 17:47:36
"The game is good,but vefore in the 2025 halloween event,i lost my three shards of my Royal Ghost even i spent days on grinding to get it to have the Evolve Royal Ghost easily,and it dissapeared",4,2026-01-07 18:04:27
"good game,but way too pay to win,and bad ballancing",4,2026-01-06 22:00:34
"very fun but kicks me out every time, so supercell, may you please level up my bomber?",5,2025-11-29 03:15:54
"Latest Update Makes the game unplayable for non-paying players. Evolved cards are just too powerful and difficult to obtain. In the past I didn't mind being a little behind the power curve against people who were dropping money on this game. I could still beat them if they weren't good and eventually I'd catch up. But the evolved cards are too good. I can't beat anyone that has one and I'm nowhere close to having my own. Been playing for over seven years and want to quit now. Bas job, Supercell.",1,2023-08-13 22:25:17
The update for losers has ruined the game! Pass royal has horrible value as well as items in the shop. Party mode no longer is rewarding and wait times are through the roof. They still have yet to fix clan wars and ladder is an absolute mess with maxed players. The rewards for challenges no longer have value. I feel like it is frustrating to play this game any more and I don't think I'll be coming back until SuperCell fixes it.,1,2023-04-15 20:48:36
"Good Job Supercell! This game is now my new favourite strategy game. Edit: Game was fun while it lasted. Eventually, you get to a point where you want to get better at the game and climb the ladder, but, that just isn't possible with the unbalanced card collecting system. Losing to people with higher level cards to you just feels so terrible; it makes climbing ladder feel like complete luck. The game would be so much better if at legendary arena card and tower levels were capped.",3,2021-12-24 11:32:22
"Matchmaking is absolutely awful and completely ruins the experience. This game is pretty nice. I've been playing for 8+ years and always enjoyed it. I found the latest updates a bit unnecessary and the game is becoming more and more pay to win. The matchmaking is absolutely horrendous. I am a level 13 player and am constantly put to battle against level 14 players. I've been counting and on the last 30 matches, 24 were against max level players. It's just unfair and I'm going to quit playing.",2,2024-10-31 21:46:32
"Honestly the gameplay itself is really original, this is probably the last supercell game to actually have an original concept, though the game is extremely pay to win for extremely stupid stuff, you can play the game without paying for anything if you know how to play the game beneficially and properly but that will take many progressions to learn all the stuff you can do in the game, not to mention they will probably put you on a public execution if you dont buy anything for 3 years",2,2025-03-07 17:18:38
"This game used to be really fun. Unfortunately, the competitive ladder is a joke. Being forced to play the same cards and having to grind to get max cards is boring. If you're willing to drop a ton of money you'll probably enjoy this game. If not, save yourself the time and frustration because late game is pay-to-win. It sucks as this game looks nice and feels very polished, not to mention that it can be a blast with friends. That said, I find the game too tilting and unbalanced to recommend.",2,2021-12-06 17:15:59
great game can be rage inducing recommending getting a little pay 2 win but not that bad,5,2025-12-01 10:35:47
"STOP PLAYING THIS GAME !! As someone who has played this game consistently for 9 years, right now is likely the worst time to play. It is just obvious now of what supercell thinks of the community by releasing lvl 16 cards, broken cards on release, suppressing backlash from creators and the removal of F2P features - this isn't a free game guys, also there isn't a point anymore to berating them ; they'll just silence you - the only way to fix this is to uninstall and wait, boycott this game.",1,2026-01-06 11:51:06
"The game is fun, I've stuck around 6 years. But with balance changes that make no sense, and the focus on using data points from top ladder with no thought to how it impacts midladder, and no new cards even on the horizon, no changes to clan wars, and updates like ""banner box"" which do nothing, I finally had to call it quits. If you're debating playing, give it a shot, but don't get too invested.",3,2022-08-17 06:44:24
"This is a fun game.. Fully optimized for cellphones. However, after playing with 2 different ID (one wigh purchase and the other without). I can fully said and fully understand the frustration of playing this game withoug paying. There is like a freaking invisible wall designed some way to keep you on losing or pairing you with big paid opponents on some occasions (which in the end luring you into purchases of those level boxes) Pay to win, otherwise, dont stress with the losses.",1,2020-04-17 14:30:38
"Was fun til they made it pay-to-win. In the past, people could pay to get some advantage, but players like me that spend few dollars here and there were still competitive. the newest Pass Royale pay package changed all that. you can no longer compete unless you pay. disappointing for a longtime player like myself. i will be looking for another game to play now.",2,2021-11-15 22:17:00
I made a brand new account and there so many p2w players. I always be lagging to and it lag on the worst time to. To be good at this game you had to play back then.,1,2025-09-22 11:53:28
the game used to be good but now they nerf all the cards and the players are toxic so don't play this game,1,2025-12-15 07:08:15
"I bought the Royale pass and it's garbage you get more prizes without it. And another thing this game has bugs like crazy, you can be in the middle of a intense game and it'll just log you out unexpectedly at first I thought they fixed it because there was an update but I was wrong. if possible I'll like to get my 5$back for paying for that garbage pass",1,2019-07-21 21:05:47
"i quit back in 2018 because the game had some cheating, miss the report button and was starting to become pay to win... Many years later it is completely and utterly plagued by cheaters and P2W. Complete garbage.",1,2025-10-27 15:45:13
"Went fron 5 stars to 1 star. Unfortunately, the new updates and changes make this game very unattractive. No more earned chests for 2v2, no more party modes, overly complicated reward, and it's just not fun anymore plain and simple. I only log in to do my clan war matches, and I don't bother to do any of the challenges. Nevertheless, I'm utterly disappointed and dissatisfied.",1,2023-05-16 11:23:24
"Game is pay to win till you everything max level. Which would take 5-10 years, playing a few games a day. Chest are time limited so It is only worth it to play one game about every 4-12 hours. If you like competition don't wase your time or spend 5-10K to reach the highest level. But is really fun and we'll made. Wish they could design the game to be less pay to win.",2,2021-11-02 07:24:45
"I don't like the fact that most unit have low hp and just die every time. I don't like how I gain trophies then lose them, I can't progress in the game because of this. Also the event with the tiers is ok but it's annoying that I would have to spend money just to get something on a game. I rated this really low because of all of this. Sort this damn game out because honestly, it's just a stupid game and people won't play it.",1,2020-04-13 05:18:10
So fun and I think it teaches why you shouldn't kill others because they will be gone forever and it's super easy and fun.,5,2025-10-07 09:17:20
"Meh, pay to win and very unfair battles. Somewhat fun if you're in to getting pounded by people who have higher level characters, but if you're going for a purely strategy based game that is fun, this isn't it. This game is also luck based and it really doesn't matter how well you plan your attack, you're still gonna lose. CoC is better, and this is just another way for supercell to make money off of impulsively stupid kids.",3,2022-05-13 22:51:21
why am I being put against people who buy evos and I can't get a single one. I'm not an evo credit card user. absolute garbage of a game. just because I do good on 1 game doesn't mean I am a god at the game. make it better,1,2025-12-21 06:45:31
"I love and hate this game. I love it because you can be toxic to people when you win, or you get abused by beat down decks and have take a 5 to reset.",2,2025-10-20 05:13:35
"I used to like this game, but Supercell is now begging me for a review again, so I'll edit this one. This game is not recommended for new players. It's not fun anymore, and the game modes just keep getting rehashed. You will mostly get matchups that are strong or average counters to your deck(s), and the clan race has no matching system that I can tell. You will either have some opponent who is far better or worse. There are rarely close or fun matches.",3,2021-01-28 15:32:51
"All of the battles are disproportionately matched. A player with level 5 and lower characters are placed against players who have level 6 characters and above. A players over all level doesn't even matter. I'm all for a close match, but this is ridiculous. This is another pay to win game☹ Edit: I have continued to play to see if it gets any better, and it doesn't, so I am uninstalling.",1,2019-06-02 06:07:09
This game is very fun but also pay to win sometimes,5,2025-12-27 21:59:44
"Great app! It's very fun to play and I don't get bored! I gave it 4 stars because I feel like I'm gonna get bored of doing the same thing over and over.But it's still a good game, definitely recommend!",4,2025-10-27 16:07:02
I'm a long time fan. Clash Royale is no longer User Friendly. What is with the glitches/bugs? It's barely fun. This game took a dive. Who is responsible for this?,1,2025-11-01 15:37:34
"6 years ago, I gave a 5-star review. Now, with the insane matchmaking, it deserves even less. Players that climbed the ladder with low-level cards but good strategy will find themselves impossible to enter or go further within the Leagues, since even at the bottom - Challenger III - they will be matched up with max-leveled opponents (king tower and all cards in level 14). You can't even enjoy the game anymore, 'cause regardless of your strategy, you will be against a maxed opponent.",2,2022-02-25 10:18:00
"Only pay to win now, you'll invest time into this game and all you get back is a slap on the wrist and an unbalanced game.",1,2025-09-11 05:23:24
"9/10 decks I played against include a mega knight and a witch, the only cards being played are mega knight, witch, wizard and firecracker it's becoming so repetitive and just not fun anymore.",1,2025-09-21 09:22:19
"Latest updates are the worst. Even the biggest content creators of this game acknowledge the issue but the devs isn't. They just spit in your face, its unbearable amount of shame! I have zero to none believe that they will change it for the best. So don't waste your time in this game **By the way i spent 9 years in this game, so i know what I'm talking about",1,2026-02-11 16:13:04
"I have one major problem, and it's that I get paired up in arena 7 with people that have level 15 cards and I'm on level 9 cards. Just make matchmaking about 3 things, Level of cards and towers(within 1 level) Trophies (obviously) and win loss ratio. *so that more skilled players fight more skilled players. (also the trailer is mid af, maybe make a trailer similar to the clash of clans ones where you animate it?)",3,2025-11-24 14:30:35
"EDIT: Balance changes at a trickle. New modes are uninspired and same-y. Longer queue times. OLD: I was a little skeptical at first by the format, but it is quite ingenious. Matchmaking is quick and game play is fun. My main complaint is that this game favors those who spend money. Even if your play is perfect, your card levels matter more. Spending real money ensures that your card levels are maxed before everyone else. In-game currency is sparse and stops F2P from progressing quickly",3,2020-09-27 05:38:51
Why im leaving a 1 star tell me how its fair to win 5 games in a row and get 29 trophies a game but when i lose to someone thats has a higher level than me and lose by 300 damage and lose 31 trophies like is it fair im on arena 18,1,2025-09-20 02:40:02
"The game is alright but, the balances... nope. one of the worst pay to win games out there and mostly no skill required if you have high level cards. Oh how do you get High level cards? well by paying of course or play this game for 2 or more years. Not balanced at all and is not fair to free to play players. NOT RECOMMENDED",1,2019-01-03 00:27:47
"absolute garbage. i hate this game. its so unbalanced and p2w. they keep adding stupid new features to make the meta worse, and their profits higher. this has genuinely become unenjoyable.",1,2025-11-24 19:27:08
"This game should be fun if it doesn't have that system that is making it take so long to progress. The pattern is so recognizable, i can already tell wether im gonna lose or win a match in a few seconds,for example, the enemy has higher level troops even from the next 2 area which is clearly unbalanced, and that happens every once in a while, and after making you lose a few times, the system will give you a bot opponent that you can recognize by the repeated name and ""no clan"" so that you win.",1,2023-12-14 10:00:37
Was fun while it lasted now it's a money slog of spending money to play the game in any fun regard. Supercell you honestly messed this one up.,1,2025-11-27 14:09:13
"I have been playing this game a long time and I was a big fan. After the release of evolutions, the game has become disgustingly pay to win. I have only started to cope when they released hero versions of cards making it even more so. I reached arena 20 before I quit to give you an understanding of how long I gave this game a chance. Delete this pay to win slop and hop on Coc. This game is nothing more than Super""sells"" biggest cash grab. To the people yet to play it. Don't.",1,2025-11-30 03:36:28
"I've been playing everyday... This is an addictive game that ends you up losing if you don't buy strong cards, they let you play with opponents 3 levels above you when they want to make you lose, it's a matter of chance to get good cards and they mostly don't gst you win strong cards to force you to buy it.. Could have been more fair than this but..",1,2020-07-27 17:57:49
Used to play this game when it came out. it was one of the best real time player games at its time and really engaging concept. But now starcell has stooped to a level of money grabbing by bombarding the game with useless upgrades and offers so that anyone can make an overpowered deck without having the fun of building everything from the scratch. I couldn't even play it for 5 mins when I re downloaded it today. I'm afraid this is gonna end up just like COC!!!,1,2024-04-22 05:04:18
I've dropped my review ...people don't give these guys a single dollar...let's see what they do when the only people playing are the few whales ...I gatentee you STOP paying them and they'll fix this now garbage cash grab..,2,2026-01-08 13:43:19
"a fun but sad game....this is my favorite game ever but today any time I try to get in, it keeps lagging and not lettinge play 😭😭😭",5,2025-12-03 20:23:06
"It is an amazing game when you are starting out, but getting up into the mid-game or late-game, you get hammered over and over by the stupidest decks known to man that somehow work for them, but then when you try them out you get absolutely dominated. Balance is absolutely horrible, love the massive health pool, tons of damage, area of effect, with a massive jump range (meta-knight) that is ""balanced"" because it costs 7 elixir, while the only 9 elixir card in the game gets one-shot by a 4 elix",1,2023-11-19 09:25:01
"Okay so, I used to love this game and it's gotten to the point where you need to spend money on everything. I haven't spent a dime on this game, and if I did I can't remember because of how forgettable the experience has been. I don't recommend until they make some serious changes like how Brawl Stars does Edit: I've since come back to the game to see if it's changed",2,2026-01-17 07:36:24
"I dont make reviews but been trying out phone games to try and find something that's free to play/challenging/fun and not completely pay to win. Now this game does have some pay to win elements but there is nothing that cant be gotten with time. Regardless of how long it takes the journey is still a fun past time thus I will give 5 stars for the sole fact it's free, fun and a good game to pass time.",5,2021-03-30 18:37:48

"This is a predatory game. Matchmaking constantly puts you up against AI or players with decks that are far advanced above your own. The Prince and the Witch are not available until arena 6 and 7 but you will be fighting them at arena 4. If you do not spend money and buy the cards, you will be at a big disadvantage and you will have to grind for crates. There is some skills involved, but it's also about who has spent more money on having a better deck. Don't let your kids play this.",1,2022-07-17 01:39:00
"Ok so lets bs honest clash royale is a clasic.I absolutely love the game and it's community,but lets bs honesr no one asked for heroes.I used to grind clash every single day i loved the game until two major things happened they added heroes and black friday heroes are way to broken,and since black friday everyone has lvl 16 cards and a bunch of evos the thing i want to say is listen to your community suppercell the only reason they added heroes was to make a quick buck.NERF MINER IG!!!!pathetic",2,2026-01-14 18:17:29

"Let me start by saying this game is fun at times. Great card concepts and very satisfying interactions between cards. The thing that hurts the game is how the cards are balanced, either way too strong or extremely weak. And how ridiculously over monetized the game is. If you are a free to play player, you are at a disadvantage due to your cards being substantially weaker depending on their level. You can win against higher level people, but it is much harder, which makes the game unfair + unfun.",2,2024-06-03 05:50:24

"One update takes hours and hours to complete. First you have to do the update on the play store which can't be done while playing the game. Then if you visit the clan board in the game, it gets stuck downloading content and takes several minutes to go 1 number so you start off 0/222 and every few minutes 1 number is added to the zero and so on and I don't have the hours to wait until everything is downloaded.

Read below I have been playing this game for 3 years, the transactions are heavy on the consumers , it's basically pay to win , in order for you to win most games you have to max your cards to the fullest which takes a lot of time .. unless you pay of course , the game is very unbalanced I have been stuck on the same league for a very long time now when I own most of the cards, the chest boxes are a joke your chances of getting legendary cards are a big joke.",1,2020-04-08 10:09:32

"This would be a good game if it wasn't for the matchmaking set up. I'm constantly pairing with someone that is 2~3 levels higher than me, not only for the castles but also the cards. Since it's almost impossible to win in that situation, I don't get chests, and if I don't get chests, I don't get cards to do the upgrades. This is clearly a strategy to make you spend money on the game buying chests. That ain't gonna happen, friend!!!",1,2019-10-20 08:10:57
"used to be a fun little game to burn time on but over the years they've steadily gone about removing all the game modes, store options and progression to F2P players while raising the price of everything in the app. I've spent money on the game in the past but can't imagine why someone would spend more money for less on any of the new offerings. I've uninstalled after the final straw of removing game modes that have existed for years. Sad to see supercell kill everything they touch.",1,2025-07-01 08:40:42
Recent changes made it unplayable without spending a ton of money. This game used to have a five star rating which I submitted in 2018. Now I can't rate it more than one star. Blatant manipulation to get people to spend a lot of money for basically nothing. You could spend thousands of dollars today and by the time the next update hits your collection will be outdated and you need to spend the same amount again for a meta viable deck. Level 15 and Evolutions killed the competetive aspect.,1,2024-04-18 17:43:20

"Edit: this game has gone so far downhill. They keep trying to ""make it better"" but it just keeps getting worse. It's my go-to for mobile gaming. In my opinion, a bit better than clash of clans. Very fun, I like the same characters from coc, seems like I'm not new when I started since I knew what they did. Very fun game.",3,2023-03-25 21:55:34
"It is a very good game, entertaining and funny, but sometimes i can't access the game without update while the update on the playstore isn't available yet. Another thing is that sometimes the Battle is against people that are much advanced than you are and in this case you keep losing many games in a row so you loose many trophies which are hard to require. Other than that this strategy games is ideal for free time , also it keeps your progress even if you haven't played or installed for years",3,2022-03-30 20:17:18

You will get to a point where you'll have to fork over $1,000s to get to the endgame or get defeated 1,000s of time while logging in several times a day for months or years. Either way, this game costs too much to play for what it is. Do Not Buy the Royale Pass. The queue is broken so it takes 2x as long to open loot. I've lost progression and cash from the $5 pass.

It seems that once we get on it take forever to put you in the game. Then by the time you get in the game either you lost or you have lost almost 30 full seconds to play. Internet connection if fine. This happened no matter where we go. It takes 1 minute to load the game. Makes you not want to play and lost tons of crowns off of that.,1,2020-12-01 23:03:32

"I won't deny that it is a lot of fun but the grind and money required to be truly competitive is rather off putting. On top of that there is wait times for unlocking chests which effectively limits the number of games you play because you don't want to ""waste"" a chest. For a casual pick up and play to burn three minutes of time once in a while it's a great choice, but if you want to seriously dedicate yourself to it then expect to hand over your bank details.",3,2021-04-08 15:18:26

Since the new update I have been experiencing great amounts of lag and it appears the game is not very optimized at the moment, whenever i load the store page my game freezes for about 4-5 seconds before loading and continues to be incredibly laggy.. never had this problem in my three years of playing this game.

But when I look at the replay, it shows that I have maxed elixir and not placing troops. Would be great if they could fix this issue.",1,2021-08-10 10:07:01
"Just deleted the game. Played for 6 years and its just broke now. Pay to win, for the loss! I use to pay $5.99 for the pass but not now. They got greedy and charge $11.99 for a similar pass now. They still have a $5.99 deal (if you can call it that) but it's watered down from what it used to be. I will not be spending anymore money on the game. It's a shame what greed does to a company.

"A very nice game. Amazing. As the other reviews say that we get opponent of a level higher than ours, and you lose then that can be your problem. We have to take care of the strategy we use. And about the cheaters, I would say that if you are good on your side then don't worry. As this doesn't happen every time. Once I fought with a 11 level player at 8 and made a draw. At 8, I fought level 10 and defeated him. But yet, the matchmaking is a bit unfair.....it can't be your problem always.",4,2022-04-27 22:40:51
"This game is a joke now ever since the new update and the introduction of pass royale you're literally being forced to pay for it to even win a game especially the challenges. Is it really a coincidence that every single player I played in the new challenges countered me perfectly, then once you do lose right there in big bold words its telling you to buy the pass to get unlimited tries. Ridiculous and honestly crazy unfair.",1,2019-07-06 02:41:18

"Been playing since launch. Game has changed a good amount. Some for the good more for the bad. I just don't trust the matchmaking anymore. They know what deck you have built (supercell) I feel to often they will exploit your decks weakness in hope you will spend money. Just trust me, great game if you don't want to be great at the game. You can be good. But to be great you will need to shovel a good amount of money. Cheers.",3,2021-11-29 07:06:39
"Not a ""party"". The newest update is awful, 10 battles, all three game options, 1 win, this is no longer fun it's a massacre. Updated because the program keeps asking. Still a massacre, played a level 13 all gold ""paid"" player, I am a level 12, with a couple level 12 cards no 13 (can't afford to pay to play game), didn't stand a chance, lasted maybe 45 seconds. That type of player should only be playing against another level 13 ""paid"" player. Make it fair for non-pay players.",1,2021-01-06 02:07:22
they're screwing the community of players that they have left with this new update. Now the game is more pay to win than it ever was.,1,2026-01-11 13:56:51
Completely ruined the game with evos. Pay to wins in every arena with somehow cards 4 levels higher than mine. Great job making a mid game even worse.,1,2025-11-07 09:02:59
I have loved this game since it came out but lately the updates have been more about screwing over the player base for money. They've sold out. Everything is more about making the game more pay to win. They rarely add new cards or anything new for the actual gameplay experience. It's all microtransaction additions. Very sad. The developers used to be so enthusiastic and now it seems like they could care less.,1,2023-04-07 03:43:08
Great game. The design has consistently been top quality and updates are still frequent. It's a game that many people can play casually or competitively. The only thing that continues to annoys me is how matchmaking can be so unbalanced in ladder and in war battles. I'd rather be matched up against players of the same level. It's nice to still have a active developers and an active community. I still recommend the game to anyone who hasn't played it and to anyone who hasn't played in a while.,4,2020-11-20 02:38:09
look I play it alot but it predominantly has a lag when I play and doesn't matter different internet connections or data. I don't pay and have not to play the game so I don't know if there is a built in retard for freeloaders. My rating is for a pay game it is always changing set up to feed in cash which is fair but it is clumsy and too frequent so if you pay you would be annoyed and also if like I you feel like appearance time for a played card seems considerably longer than your opponent then,3,2023-04-21 13:40:43

"This game used to be so much fun back in the day but with the recent update for losers and lvl 15 that changed up so many of the ftp options the game quickly became unfun. Additionally, it's now even harder for persons who don't spend money to get lvl 15 and elite wild cards and overall progress in the game. I've been playing for years but finally decided to uninstall today, it's been fun, but the future of the game doesn't seem bright with the way the developers are doing things now.",2,2023-07-01 06:51:47
"I have been playing this game for many years (at least since 2018/2019, if not earlier. I used to LOVE this game, I made friends and family download it so we could play together, and it was a blast! I had great times and really enjoyed farming my way up. Since the introduction of the ""double battle pass"" and evolutions, I think they've been pushing a bit too much into the hard currency rewards / pay to advance mechanics, but what I personally find worse of all is the endless scrolling in the UI",2,2023-10-24 00:03:39
"This game has efficient and effectively ruined itself in one update. There is no point in playing the game anymore. I have played this game for 7 years, and I don't think I'll be coming back. With the addition to level 15, you have made an environment to encourage people to spend money to upgrade to level 15, and have no reliable way for ftp players to gain Elite Cards.

9 year player and next update is too far. Top 5 greediest dev teams of all time that do anything but listen to the play base to keep pushing the goal post to see your credit card numbers. And refusing to show the wild card gem conversion rate probably because they know people won't like the rate is genuinely evil. I loved this game to death in its early years and now it's hardly recognizable I'm done,1,2025-11-23 02:44:10

"It's pretty good, been playing since launch. Some things I would disagree with, but I like the game a lot. Very nostalgic, and I love the game to death. Hee Hee Haw Haw.

"The evolution characters are terrible. They make the game less about strategy since you can just drop certain character behind certain others and do a lot of damage without even thinking. Sure you can counter it with exactly the same thing, but that is not why a lot of us play. If you are making more money by doing that then by all means, but you won't make another dollar from me without getting rid of them. The giant knight is enough for the stupid people that do not know how to play.",1,2024-03-20 05:40:21
"They change the game too much without fixing any of the real issues. I've been playing this game for about a year, I have bought in most of that time. Instead of fixing glitches or finding a way to fix the unfair match up in the game, they change how the cards play. Every 3 to 6 months you have to relearn how all the pieces work, but still have to deal with the glitches and cheaters.",1,2021-12-09 13:39:09

"I am playing CR since 2017 and the game used to be a great, great strategy game with a lot of deks to use. The characters were balanced and the battles were fun. But now, with all that evolution cards everything was ruined. No more fun to play, overpowered deks which I don't like to build as everybody does. Also the clan members are playing CR ... or better said were playing since 2017 ... 2018, but now, one by one is quiting the game. So, I think I will also quit soon. That's it ... sorry😒",1,2024-03-26 11:15:17
"The game would be good with balancing, but to be frank about it, all the meta has been for half a year now is spamming low elixir cards until you overwhelm the opponent. It makes for a very boring and frustrating experience especially when you're leveling or in clan battles. I've maxed out everything in the game so the only thing I play is clan battles, but they're all spam based and take no skill to win. It doesn't make for a very competitive game. Balance the game and maybe I'll come back",1,2024-07-27 00:53:24
"This game breeds toxicity, and literally makes money off of it. Pay to win, buggy, lag when placing cards down leading to losses in ranked. Fix the bugs and it's be much better. Also, do something about the toxic player base. Allow reports for spamming emotes and if someone racks up a bunch from a number of different people they should be banned.

For the past games i have played I played against players with level 12 and 13 cards at at clash level 11.

"The pass is DISGUSTINGLY pay to win. For any tournament that takes place, you can just pay 5 dollars for the special pass, and get every reward since you have unlimited continues. This gives players who play for free a huge disadvantage on all stages because players who paid get all the new cards, and coins to upgrade their cards and outlevel them by 2-3, in which strategy is no longer needed, but rather just spam as many troops as you can to overwhelm the opponent. This is NOT strategy.",1,2020-12-06 01:53:59
Level 15 is the most money grab move as a company. Max players don't spend money on the game(pass royale included) thus they made their pass more expensive and now are adding s new level. Making it so no players in order to advance even remotely competitively must buy the pass and spend more money. Most polls show less than 6% of the player base want new levels for cards. So the illusion they are trying to spin that they are doing this because casuals want another level is absurd and incorrect.,1,2023-06-23 16:07:58

You will get to the challenger arenas and everyone has the highest level cards while your king is lvl 10 and your cards 9-11. You will be forced to give up playing the game, because you the game stops being about strategy. The enemy's worse decisions don't matter because the level difference is too big.

Clash Royale is in a dark place right now as one of the people that still occassionly plays this game and can still sometimes enjoy it. it's upsetting how much worst this game has gotten. Ladder is a mess (unfair) and it's the main way to progress. The multiplayer can be so much better. Draft should be always playable and what happened to touchdown?. I hope this game can return back to the highs it had but right now I'm not sure. Fix your game supercell,1,2024-11-24 15:22:51

I'm not sure if it's my device or the update, it's now either goodbye or hello again.",2,2023-10-15 04:35:09
"Finally the game is good and not pay to play anymore. When the game first came out, it was nearly impossible to get all the cards without spending money, especially the legendaries. Then they increased the level capfrom 8 to 13 (i think). But now the rates are much higher, and if you play enough, everything is easily accessible. I think the game is fine tuned and balancing is not the much of a problem with some exceptions. Well done.",4,2021-04-02 19:35:35

Developers care more about profits than the actual gameplay experience and keep adding absurd features. The matchmaking constantly puts you against players several levels above you, or against hard counters.

"It was irritating simply because the game kept matching me up with someone at a higher level. This game is what's called a ""Money Grab"" meaning you can't win MOST matches because the other person payed cash for better cards.

The concept is great but the only problem is the ganeplay side of it which almost completely ruins the game for some. I understand the fact that SuperCell is a business trying to make money, but there needs to be a limit to how much you can buy so that those who don't have money can still enjoy to a much higher extent.

"Love it, played it for years, but I just got it on my new phone and it doesn't work well. I can load it up but sometimes I load in very late to match or a game crashes mid match making me lose. Sometimes I can't finish 1 match without crashing. Wish there was a way to fix it, I'm on a Qlink Hot pepper phone.",3,2020-07-08 09:36:28
"Crazy that they took the turn to paid to win. I've been playing this game since day 1. The pass originally being released was a new big thing, but not too bad, $3.99 at the time. Not only did they up it to $5.99 now, but they also added the 'diamond pass' for $11.99. You get a substantial amount of cards and gold, which are exclusive to the diamond pass. The shop now is another story. The grind aspect is literally gone now. Maybe make the basic pass gem purchasable to make a bit more fair??",1,2023-09-28 01:32:14
"Game has algorithms that chooses which deck is counter to your deck and vice versa against other players. Game technically and literally chooses who has an advantage over the other. If the algo is with you, you get an opponent that has a weaker deck. Otherwise, the game gives you an OP opponent and their deck is counter to yours. In the higher ranks, you'll really notice this. It's not random, it's not a game of chance, it's a game of the house and it decides who wins. The house always wins.",2,2020-06-21 01:27:03
"The season pass introduced on april 3rd 2023 totally messed up the experience. Not only is more expensive but also sucks.The game is grindy as it is, pass royale offered a few options to at least level up certain cards of your choice each month, option that is still somehow there, but with seasonal cards, which is a no no. I just uninstalled the game, have been playing from the very begining, it's a shame that greed ruined what was an entertaining game",1,2023-04-06 04:35:14

"This game is a shocker. Do you know how many times when you are on level 9 or 10 you have to play somebody on level 12 and even level 13. This makes this game a total waste of time. Developers have taken shortcuts in the making of this game. How ironic it is that it is very easy to reach higher levels only thing is guess what, that's right it costs you money. Clash Royal stay away.",1,2020-12-20 02:32:27
"I never take the time to write full blown reviews, but this new update is truly annoying .

"I've been playing this game for the past 3 years. The game constantly looks to update and develop which is great! However, the 1v1 battles have recently become a joke. One game you'll get a decent match up against a similar level player e.g. Lvl 12 with a mix of lvl 11, 12 cards, the next you'll get someone who's lvl 13 with maxed out cards and a complete mismatch. This area of the game needs addressing as players like myself get disorientated with 1v1 battles.",4,2019-02-11 01:29:53
"The latest update has absolutely ruined the game for me. It's garbage when you're forced to play a game a certain way. You are the developer, not the player. You make the game, and we enjoy it whatever way makes us happy. I played clash of clans from the beginning, then super cell broke it. And it appears that they intend on doing the same with clash royal.",1,2023-04-17 03:37:51
Initially this game was fun and it felt like free to play players had a fair chance. But its not like that anymore. The latest addition of the pass is just one big money grab. The mini events kept me excited but now they are all messed up. Because people who buy the pass quit and leave the second they feel like they are falling behind.. they don't care they have endless lives anyway.. hell some just left the match intentionally so free to play players like me get a free loss.,2,2019-07-19 06:11:55
"Nice Supercell 👍 Added a new season with a whole brand new card that can't even be played for f2p players unless you spend $40 depending on where you live. The only way to play the new cards is through spending 10 or 100 gems for the classic or grand challenges. Removed Chest which is a big part of the whole game to progress, but now if you just installed the game you can't unlock the 8th card. Then nerfing the pass for people who pay for the pass, making the progression a lot more difficult.",1,2025-04-09 04:15:13
"Clash royale has been a balanced game for most of its lifetime now, with occasional spending necessary to truly dive into it. However, since the arrival of evolutions(2023), the power creep has exponentially grown. The next update will even double that; an additional level and a stronger form of evolutions. The entire community is against it. Clash Royale made tons of money the last years, but they're now ruining the game to make more while there was still so much more to gain from evo's only...",1,2025-11-23 20:15:51

"Very good game and very fun and entertaining, there isn't really any bugs but my one problem is that I feel like they put you in a match where the guy has 2 more king tower levels higher than you, it doesn't seem fair imo, I get that they might not want to make players progress too fast but I feel like it'll still bum out some players like me",3,2022-06-18 14:30:04
"Edit: rating this now a one star. Originally a 3. Designed for you to be countered and to lose 80% of the time. Has a fun aspect. Other than that, just is frustrating. Seems less random and more opponents that ""happen to"" counter your deck. On top of that, there are many instances where your opponent is able to pull off cards that are high price back to back to back in a matter of seconds. Crazy. Overall, pretty cool game that helps you get frustrated with hopes of you spending money.",1,2023-09-24 15:56:14
"I've been playing for about 4-5 years. A level of difference in cards makes the game entirely unbalanced. It is unfair to play against and unsatisfying with, because you may have only won because of the strength of your cards, not the skill and strategy of the player. 4-5 years I've been playing, I have yet to own anycards to max level. As i would rather vary my playstyle instead of funnel my resources into a one deck. The games mechanic to keep players playing. Gave me a negative experience.",1,2024-03-13 07:41:21
"So begin, I've played this way before many of its QOL updates, and stopped playing since then. I re-downloaded the game, just to try and have fun with it, and I specially do not recommend it! Card balance DO NOT exist for some cards, making some of them completely useless in terms of meta. To make the experience worse, Evo cards and champions are added, which completely ruins the game for newbies and returners. Unless you're willing to fork over money, I don't recommend Clash Royale at all!",1,2024-03-28 23:07:23
"I've played a lot of this game. While it may be fun at a base level at this point the game is nosediving straight into the ground in terms of pay to win and terrible development decisions. They just crank out terrible update after terrible update where the obvious motive is not to make the game better but to make more money. They also increase the level cap sporadically, which means even if you're maxed eventually they'll ask for more. Don't play it.",1,2023-04-30 21:13:09
Backwards balancing. They have the side games lvl and balanced at 11 across the board but their ranked is pay to win.. I have lvl 12 and every other match I play is against lvl 14 and the levels are slow to get and very time consuming so the only way to catch up is to pay real money to catch up... not a small amount.. atleast not for the average person.. don't play this game unless you got the extra cash!!,1,2022-10-04 22:10:36
"I previously had a 5 star review, but within the past 2 months I had some second thoughts. This game is amazing and very fun with strategy but in a different way, and it's extremely competitive. The main reason that I changed my review from 5 star to 2 star is because of matchmaking, when and if you get to arena 13 you are paired with other players who counter you completely. The next reason I chose to change my review is becose as you get more trophies the game becomes pay to win.",2,2020-11-05 02:35:05

"Gets worse every update... been playing since day 1 and the matchmaking and lagging into games is now absolutely terrible. I used to love this game but like every other free game, they eventually run out of decent ideas for changes. Cards like the Electro Giant are extremely OP and almost unstoppable. Regular games are okay but the Challenges (due to matchmaking) are almost unbeatable. Been stuck at level 12 for close to a year and I play daily. No money=No rank up",3,2021-03-31 08:15:11

"I had this game 16 years ago, but it was fun to revisit it again. The game was great, not really and bugs or anything of the like. But, there was one problem. I was getting put with people WAY above me. They had much higher level cards, they had cards that where 3 or 4 arenas above me. So that just made the game a whole lot harder and annoying. lots of the time I would have lose streaks of a few games, win one, then lose a whole other set of matches. Please fix the grouping system. Overall great",3,2021-01-01 06:09:40
"The new update should have changed the name to ""Crash Royale"". Before the update it deserved a 5 star.

"The game is a fraud because it is advertised as a strategy game when it is ridiculously dependant on spending money if you wanna have decent wins, the matches are supposed to be based on who uses their cards better ""having the same amount of elixir availability, but it doesn't take a genius to notice that doesn't happen, those who don't pay some money to win can clearly use less elixir during a match.",1,2026-01-18 05:56:19
"What starts off as fun soon turns into a frustrating mess, this game brings you in with its recognisable Clash of Clans art style and card based gameplay and then slaps you in the face with its microtransactions and unfair matchmaking. The moment I spent any money in the game, I immediately experienced the sunk cost fallacy as i started forcing myself to play on a daily basis even when i was tired of the game.

"I love this game I play it all the time, but there are obscenely huge flaws in the game I've had fun playing I've even bought two season passes, but the negatives in this game highly out weight the positives. Obscenely overpowered cards, and completely unfair battles. I'll be honest beating those a level or two below me was fun, then i shortly realised the awful feeling of just being completely destroyed by people higher leveled than me, and the trophy loss is substantially high, its unnecessary.",1,2019-10-05 13:02:28
"Iv'e been playing this game for almost 4 years now, and it's the only game on my phone since it'a so invigorating. However, it has become almost unbearable for free players. As a level 13 (max), the speed in which you can upgrade your cards is painfully slow compared to Pass Royale players. And the fact that challenges are so expensive Gems wise (50-100 gem challenges appear much more than 10-20 gem challenges) while gems feel more rare is even more annoying. My patience is about to run.",1,2019-09-30 20:32:49
"Took a break from this game 4 two years. Nothing has changed. The matchmaking is garbage and sets you up to either go on a win streak or lose 20 in a row. You will notice that when you change your deck the game will take a little longer to match you so you get the result SuperCell wants. Opposing units change targets strategicly, yours won't. Absolutely the worst cheating game I have ever played. SuperCell sets you up so that you will make in app purchases and waste your money. This game sucks!!",1,2022-12-09 12:21:28

"An okay game at best. It tends to lag right when you need to play a card, meaning that defence is impossible. People that spend money on the game will always beat other people which is unfair and takes all of the fun out. Chests also take way to long to open and never give you anything good anyway.

People could re use the same cards at least 10 times because they have some cheap cards and its frustrating cause I work my up then lose my account do it again and then I lose that one, so i worked my way up again hoping it doesn't happen and spent so much time and all i get is a free chest and 10 gems which is rare.",1,2019-09-30 11:23:04
The 2v2 is a really silly idea when your teammate can just leave halfway in the battle causing it to become 1v2. This is just one of them. I killed one of the enemies castles. The network was perfect till the castle was down. The red wifi error came out for 10 seconds and the enemy managed to win me in just this 10 seconds when I was unable to place any cards. I was sitting at the same spot (cannot be my wifi or mobile data is lesser).,1,2019-11-16 15:14:44
"This game was great in its early times, now with all that pass royale and events. This game has become highly in the favour of pay to win players but still how can we forget how cool this game is. I mean I haven't played a game so strategy based and great graphics in my life. Even a second and block placement matters when you play. You need to be highly accurate about your moves when u play and with each win and lose your unlock new strategies in your mind. Overall i think 4 stars are good.",4,2023-03-24 16:01:06

"Since the new update, it has changed the whole game and the way it's played. Now, this game feels like it just wants your money and buying the pass isn't enough anymore.

The game is really fun but the problem is when you play in high arenas the game gives you a player that is alot higher in level than you and also the chests are the worst thing i ever saw in this game because they never give you what you need and it is very rare to get a magical chest or even a golden one. Another problem is the mega knight this card is absolutely unstoppable and it is very hard to beat,3,2020-08-15 02:46:44
"I love this game but the most recent update has made it to no matter what format I battle in, wifi or no wifi, the load into the match is so long that the battle is done before I even get in. This has made it hard to obtain any chests and my ranking has suffered since this has been going on for days now. Please fix this. Update: fixed that but now I cannot get into certain screens on certain days (look at cards to purchase or change my emote order). The game freezes and have to reload.",2,2019-11-20 19:52:47

This is a great game. Nice to pass some time and have fun with friends. But there are some problems with this game. The developer should at least leave some way in which we can buy skins without money. And they should plan for something when the players network connection is lost. Like it is frustrating when I have to get 0 stars specially in CWL due to my network being lost for 5 seconds. Overall without these problems it's a great game. I hope you'll fix these issues.,4,2024-12-03 13:27:35
this game is pretty good. except with the new update it constantly crashes. mostly during matches which cause me to lose them since I can't open the app back in time. it ALWAYS freezes for a good 10 seconds and occasionally crash when I open my daily quests and open the shop. not to mention the predatory pay to win B.s they've come out with.,1,2019-07-05 21:50:34

Well think it is time to uninstall this game. I really liked it too despite its lack of progression before the update. Now I can attest that the new update really butchered supercells user count. Pay to win is something I never really thought this app would emphasize more. The 4.99 price for pass was agreeable (even though I never bought it). Now for $12 with extra perks for non pass players and take away 2v2 rewards 😂 what a joke.,1,2023-04-12 19:09:56

At one point i grinded at the game and ended up having 3246 trophies only to go to 3000 trophies in a few matches, it's as if the game is intending for you to stay at your arena for as long as you can unless you buy something.",1,2021-11-24 09:47:01

The game is turning really stupid I am playing against pros when I am just a person who's playing for fun. It's near impossible winning in this game unless you spend 12hr a day training. You'll update the game everytime making it worse and more complicated. Its not an easy game after every update. you have changed the game completely and for making more money throw more offers. this is a really horrible method of making money and not giving the people the satisfaction they need. horrible updates,1,2025-11-30 02:07:01

"Have been stuck with an unselective deck for over a month. In 1v1 and 2v2 challenge. Due to having mostly all else complete It was my main game play for masteries and chest rotation. Wasted my whole paid for pass last month, so won't be bothering again untill fixed. Went through support at the start of the issue and still being told that the issue is known but as yet they still don't have a fix so they can't do nothing. No compensation offered, just a "" we are attempting to fix"" every time.",1,2024-08-19 19:16:26
"future me back here,has gotten even worse,horrible match ups against max players in arena 18 they will say its a skill issue until they try and defend a level 15 evo megaknight and me trying to scrape away at the level 15 towers.This game is slowly going downhill",1,2025-08-29 21:06:46

"I continued to be put up against higher level players until I've decreased in trophies a 100-300, which is very annoying to try to gain back with their terrible match making. Sometimes, my opponents are super easy. Other times, they are 2 levels ahead of me with max cards. This game is just very frustrating 80% of the time. They've made the game so pay to win its honestly ridiculous, and I had to uninstall the games from pure frustration and saving myself the annoyance.",1,2023-04-20 09:59:22
The only thing that sucks about this game is that the matchmaking will put you against some your skill level then when you beat them you get put against players way better than you. This can cause constant losing streaks and the game becames frustrating and you cant progress. I think the best way to stop this frustration would be so you dont have to be good to progress.,3,2020-01-30 10:02:57
The game was good before but now who spend money on the game only those win all the time. Fed-up with the game mechanics. Should be match season pass to season pass player and non season pass to non season pass. Once you reach higher level matches with higher player then you. Contently losing every 5 battle in a row for 1 win. How can we enjoy playing it. Fed-up with game mechanics. I will uninstall in near future and search for better game. No fun now.,1,2022-04-15 09:28:18
"Been playing since it came out. Truly the best game out there.Very competitive and strategic. Best gameplay and graphics by far. I'm at a loss for words reading some of these review's. People actually get mad at people for spending money, hard earned money. The app specifically says in-app purchases. Don't hate on people for using gems to upgrade. Listen don't expect to be maxed out in an instant. It takes years to be maxed. Just play the game, get in a good clan, and enjoy it. Don't give up!!",5,2020-02-07 02:16:51
"This game was wonderful, but now is terrible. If you want to have a reasonable position in ranking you just have to pay for it. The level of cards of most players is maximum or one less. If you want to change your deck you just can't, because you won't win against 1000 player with wizard on 14 lvl. This game is hell for players whom don't want to pay and just have fun. The matchmaking system is awful , no matter what is your cards level you will be put against players with maximum card levels.",2,2021-12-15 13:51:24

"Initially fun to play. I've been playing since the beginning, but it got old when I reached a point where the majority of my losses are due to opponents who simply throw a lot of money at the game. They pay to level their troops up ahead of the normal game progression. They win only because their troops are simply that much better, and it takes the skill completely out of the game. That's no fun at all.",1,2020-09-10 18:55:30
this game is super fun I'm in Arena 11 and all the games I go against is pay to win I think they had too much pay to win and it really makes it hard for the f2p players rank up,3,2025-11-02 16:06:50

"I have an idea to improve gameplay! Maybe you could add some extra communication options for 2v2 battles? You could add some extra click icons for a player to communicate with his teammate by adding options like: attack, defend, help or wait icons on the left and right side of the arena. This would avoid lots of anger, frustration and people quitting battles early. What do you think of my suggestion?",4,2018-11-16 05:22:16
"The match making system is broken. The game is fun, amazing card game but unbelievably hard to climb the ranks. Almost every opponent I've faced in the 2 years I've played have been 1-3 levels higher than me. It's incredibly frustrating to play a ranked game just to get stomped by a player with level 12-13 cards who can one-shot your cards and 4 shot your towers. There's no counterplay until they match you up with same level players which come once in a blue moon. Hope they listen and fix it.",2,2020-01-12 01:10:54
"I loved this game but now it is turning into a huge ""get money"" scheme. They put out an update with something that's pretty cool and after a while in the next update they limit it and then make you pay for it if you want it.

"The release of card evolutions was only the start of a long journey for Supercell to greedily extract every last dollar from the player base, killing the strategical elements and making the game unplayable if you don't constantly spend money to keep up with the new editions.

You cannot play this game competitively anymore without spending hundreds.",1,2024-07-06 00:19:27
This game has become more pay to win than it has before. It is near impossible when I have mostly level 12 troops facing a team of level 14 troops at +7000 trophies. Everything is harder to upgrade because of the amount of gold you get so you have to pick and choose what you want to upgrade and can't try any other decks out because the other troops are under level compared to other people with the same deck.,1,2025-08-10 04:16:23

"It's incredible how you can make a game so amazingly good and bad at the same time. They add items to help players enjoy the game then they make stupid cards amazing and others not usable. I have an enemy place down one card(elite barbs,golem, royal giant) and I already just want to close the app because I'm sick of it. I think they should focus on making cards balanced not new broken cards each season.",2,2021-04-13 12:32:41

Though trade tokens can really help F2P players, they still have to be willing to spend a lot of time on the game (I literally mean 5+ MONTHS) to acquire max level cards (let alone A FULL DECK).

Skill decides maybe 10-20% of the game, and the rest is how much money you spend on upgrades, and what the matchmaker decides to pit against you. Free-to-play and low-roller players have been virtually squeezed out of competition.",1,2024-04-07 01:49:30

But now, with endless upgrades (level 15, 16, 17), star levels, and “super” upgrades, it feels like an infinite grind designed to drain time and money. Progress never feels complete, and it’s frustrating rather than fun. I used to rate 5 stars, but now it deserves only 1. If I could, I’d give 0. This game has lost its charm.",1,2025-09-02 16:54:46

Progression is intentionally slowed (at times without any warning) so that players have to pay if they want to win.

They made evolutions absolutely broken so that you need them to win so that players are ""encouraged"" to buy from the shop. Maddening.",1,2023-07-11 22:02:57

You'll be stuck in a loop where you won't be able to proceed to the next level unless you buy their packs to level yourself up, because organically leveling up will take months per the game design",1,2023-03-17 19:33:23

my opinion doesn't matter to this well funded service. I had left a previous positive review but with their changes just seems like I don't belong with what Supercell wants as a consumer.

Clan wars was bad but clan wars 2.0 is even worst. Worse than touchdown. Only thing that kept the game is fresh monthly balance changes, which they killed.",1,2021-02-20 16:12:36
Good game but you do have to spend a lot of money if you want to progress without it burning hours of time. Also in app purchases could be cheaper and sometimes people who spend loads of money is an unfair advantage to people who don't.Balance changes are also annoying because troops' stats are lowered more than they are raised.,3,2021-01-18 23:53:34

I have only had this problem for the past year and i took a break to see if they would fix it. Nope. First game back crashes mid way through and i lose.

They aren't that bad but there is too many. Plus 3 hours is far to long to wait to unlock only 24 cards.

But they heavily took away the purchasing power from gems so buying them isn't worth it at all. SuperCell wants you to pay money straight for cards and evolution shards if you want to win at a higher level. It's not worth playing the game if the height of gameplay is locked behind a paywall.",2,2025-05-10 00:36:15
Very very fun game. But there is a major issue in the game. When a person is in the higher leagues it is nearly impossible to advance further in the game.

I love this game and have been playing it for nearly 6 years now but there is one thing I noticed which is quite poor as a gaming experience.

Also this game isn't really about who has the best skills and strategy it's mostly about the cards for example the level of the card and what it does you climb by playing decks that counter certain other decks. Really bad game you can be competitive and put hours into this game but while doing so you will not enjoy the game, it requires you to abuse op cards and tilt the opponent to win.

"CR used to be a great game, but now it's unbalanced and frustrating. I've been playing for three years and reached over 6000 trophies, but the game's current state is unbearable. The matchmaking system constantly pairs me with higher-level players, making it almost impossible to win. In the past few days, I've lost 15 matches in a row, which is extremely frustrating.I don't recommend CR to anyone. It's an unbalanced game that doesn't reward skill, and it's become frustrating and demotivating.",1,2023-04-07 16:12:14
good game. but I keep getting games with hackers. they keep playing cards super fast with a high cost.,3,2025-10-22 22:50:46
"P2W, I been playing this game more than 5 ""I recently downloaded again"" years now and I hate this game is not even fun anymore the match making sucks and I cant even play when my opponent have 8 evo cards is unbalanced and unfair and this company is so greedy is honestly sad how this company become",1,2025-09-19 11:44:22
fun games for strategy and challenges,5,2025-12-06 14:07:39
Game started off well. The kids programming the game set it up so you get deep enough in before it becomes impossible to continue without in game purchases. I got to about 1500 trophy points before I lost roughly 15 straight matches. Before that I rarely lost more than 2 before I won again. I wouldn't recommend the game until they stop regulating the outcomes to produce more income.,1,2019-06-08 09:20:28
I like the game and one of my family members play but when I finished the pass royal It said I get the diamond pass for free but I didn't so that is the only complaint I have so far please fix this soon.,4,2025-10-21 21:32:55

"I have played this game on and off for a couple years. But I always seem to come back to it! With each update they add more content. Cards, quests, gamemodes, all improving the quality of life for the players. This is the only mobile game I actually enjoy and stick with haha! Furthermore, even their customer service is legendary. A friend of mine COMPLETELY lost his account a year ago, and they were able to verify it was his and return it to him in a prompt manner once he started the process.",5,2018-12-23 00:02:19
fun game definitely pay to win now but one cam use strategy to beat a higher level troop but definitely pay to win... overall a pay to win game game designers don't really implement changes the players want rather than the bow down to youtubers and leave smooches on their hind side as nobody asked for evo furnace or even the 'tarded spirit empress... but hey they pay the youtubers to play and if you want to play you have to pay! all in an all this is a pay to play and pay to win...,5,2025-08-31 08:42:44

"Impossible to play without selling half of my liver on the black market to afford these purchases. First evolutions, now level 16 and two more hero slots?! What?! I can't believe how hard they're trying to kill their game. Played it when it was good, never again.",1,2025-12-01 23:30:57
To be honest the game was quite good but theres this one problem i've had and that is when i cant even deploy anything i just straight up lose. my connection isnt the problem nor my device as ive tested them both (and it's just as what is normal) and the big problem is the fact that it is in the event i was actually gonna win the game but i cant deploy anymore thus resulted to a loss a one sided battle mid game and the worst thing is the fact that i now have 2 loss which is rather disappointing,4,2021-01-12 18:34:41
I think this game is fun and is enjoyable and gives me self confidence.,5,2025-12-14 05:09:34
"was a fun game not with this new update that they did last month the change sucks they took are book's away for leaving up an character and now most of the characters that I have leveled up.They need to be re level up, and they're making it harder to leveling up like you need to spend more money to re leveling up the character, it's a money hungry world they will take the small joy of life just to try to get more out of you",2,2025-12-18 19:26:42
Yes this game is pay to win. That's not my primary reason for rating it the way I have. Been playing this game for 5 years on and off. I can confidently tell you that they manufacture luck and your progress. You will feel like youre the king of the world at some point climbing mid ladder winning games left and right. And then you won't. Supercell will in fact give you opponents youre almost guaranteed to lose against but then also give you almost guaranteed wins to feel like you've made progress,2,2025-12-24 11:22:43

"I've been playing Clash for 3.5 years and by far it's one of the best games out there for mobile; Although, here lately everything has been leaning more towards making you spend money on the game. Now you may ask, ""What do you mean by this?"" Well my answer is for example, look at war, the match making is so bad. All the under leveled players struggle in war because they are constantly get matched with close to or fully max players and to our ""surprise"" those players have purchased Pass Royale.",3,2022-06-27 15:58:31
"I've been playing since the game was new. This last update is terrible. When going to the shop tab the app freezes for a few seconds which it never used to before. I was in the middle of a game and my screen just went black - I had to kill the app and restart it and by that time the game was lost. I could deal with the pass royale being waved in my face from everywhere, but don't make the game experience worse. You have guaranteed I won't pay for this bad user experience. Sort out your priorities",1,2019-07-05 05:23:25
"Been a longtime player but only because there arent any better mobile games of this genre, and that is saying something because the balance is terrible and the pay-to-win is essential.

Every day I get closer to uninstalling again as I lose to people for the sole reason of them having higher level cards.",3,2019-09-28 09:00:17
"This app used to be good, frustrating at times when you were on a losing streak, but good nonetheless. With this last update the game went from ""pay to not grind"" to ""pay $60 a year to win."" This may have just ruined a previously good game. I am disappointed in the bugs as well. The game used to run smoothly but now it crashes constantly. Overall I think the game, at its core, would deserve 4 or 5 stars but in it's current state I can say that anything above 2 stars is generous.",2,2019-07-04 00:35:33

this game has been destroyed. you ruined it for older players. how is it that someone who's only played for a year is higher than me in card levels and trophies when I've played for almost a decade... you've inflated the value of coins and diminished the value of legendaries.

There is little to no effort to fix this, as in subsequent updates, supercell seems to only focus on introducing new evolutions to make more and more money.

"Extremely pay to win. After like 3 months playing it, you reach a state where it's pretty much impossible to keep advancing since the game forces you to spend money to keep earning trophies again and without paying the gameplay becomes totally stale.

You could say it's following the trends of other games which is fair to say however the level this game pushes it to is obscene. The amount of money they charge for season passes, minor upgrades and evolutions is outrageous. You also need these to compete, first few weeks playing are blast until you softly get hit by the pay wall where everything quickly becomes pay to win. Sad to see.",2,2024-12-20 23:37:37

It was fun at first, I've bought 2 battle passes to date and enjoyed the game, even through all the frustrating enemies that are 3 levels above me making it impossible to win, I felt like I was slowly but surely progressing. Now it's telling me I can't go up to the next arena because I'm not high enough king level. Why was this implemented? I'm so far from the next king level, it's thoroughly ruined my experience, there's no progression.",1,2023-01-13 11:10:38
"Merge tactics may be the most broken pay to win mode you've ever introduced. Echo sage and battle mechanic are completely unfair to those who don't pay.

"I used to play this game when it's first came out but stopped playing after sometime for some reason. Recently I reinstall the game because I remembered it being good fun, now when I came back all my previous progression is lost. I had to start from beginning. Now it's more about pay to win and less about strategy and deck building. Then if you want the new evolution cards you have to pay double the amount of game pass. If u want a evolution card without paying you need six seasons to unlock one",1,2023-12-14 23:15:47
"I have played this game since the day it came out in beta... it's always been amazing and fun, the regular updates and changing of the stats/etc. it's all fun, the events and different modes of play, it keeps you engaged ..... however, 5+ yrs of religious gaming, and I can't get higher than like challenger 2 arena, or 5000 trophies. tbh, as times gone on the game has been more of pay to play than anything. skill level means nothing, once you get such a high level, it costs too much to go further",1,2022-06-07 09:02:52
"Very good but, why are all the epics shoved into arena 6? It's not all that fair, I think that the prince, witch, baby dragon, and guards.

So if you could, it would make starting a lot easier.",4,2023-01-22 12:29:40
"Some how, after five years, the game actually feels worse. It feels less fun to play, and way more money hungry. It feels like more work goes into finding ways to get more money from players, than the actual game. The same decks are used exclusively, less used cards and decks were never buffed or reworked, some how the clan wars are even more mind numbing. The game no longer feels like it's catered to having fun, it's all about pay to win and staying relevant on the competitive gaming scene.",1,2021-06-13 11:59:41

It is sad to see a developement team care so little about this great game. They just care about milking every last penny out of your pocket. Playing on a high level as a f2p player is impossible right now. Level 15 was a joke and now level 16 is as bad as level 15 with the addition of broken heroes every new season that are impossible to obtain as a f2p player but give you a huge advantage. If your opponent knows what he is doing you will almost never win if he is playing with 2 heroes and you 0,1,2026-01-29 21:45:22

Ive been playing since one month after launch over multiple accounts and all its become is a cash grab. There used to be a decent matchmaking system but now you play 2-4 games and the game starts matching you with people who have a significant advantage in levels over you. Level 13 gameplay has very few good meta options over the last year and anything less feels like the game begs you to spend money. I loved this game but i cant keep playing if the matchmaking system remains such garbage.,1,2020-07-27 13:45:36
"Been playing this game for a long time and I really enjoy the game but these days the game seems to be unbalanced when talked about one on one match, either low level opponent or very high level and I never get to play against the opponent that has the same level which is not a good thing or I enjoy playing. Only if the developers fix this I would give a 5 star ...",3,2022-10-27 20:25:08
getting worse day by day. if you spend money you'll get loads of rewards from everywhere and if you don't you'll get a couple hundred cards from 5star lucky chest. So if you don't want to spend money on this then clash royale isn't the game you should play. It's too frustrating and I will not recommend anyone to download this game. every real hardworking player should quit this game for good.,2,2026-01-09 06:02:30
"Sometimes the fame freezes, only 4 slots for the chest, not enough time to win big. Work on the lagging and freezes, more slots to play more rounds to win chests and send out more chances to get the bigger chests. Paying money for a monthly pass so other players with higher levels can crush and laugh at you. The ranking system on who you fight needs plenty of work. Crames you with cards but little ways to upgrade them.",1,2021-01-02 03:57:37

"At the beginning it was an awesome game. I cannot give more that 2 star because recently it's having huge issues with connectivity, with a strong wifi signal or a strong wireless signal it's doing the same thing which is at the middle of the battle it logged me out and makes me lose time and battles. Also in every match you get an opponent stronger with a higher level that you which it makes it difficult to win. Sorry , only 2 stars.",2,2019-10-21 07:06:39

Please fix the notifications for Android. They are consistently wrong; they show up when 'a chest has unlocked' and nothing is even close to unlocked. They also push a notification every few hours to 'not let your streak end!' when I've already completed my streak games today. Every notification I get from this game is useless spam. Please fix them.,1,2025-01-08 19:48:14

"The game was slowly ruined, used to be my favorite. I've been playing since global release. I'd grind on three different accounts and would get hours of playtime a day. Every since Clan Wars 2, the game got steadily worse. Gone were the fun makeshift decks in clan war, and now it was a gruesome grind to get lvl 14 cards. Finally, the losers update ruined the fun of the essential part of the game. Edited from a 5 star",1,2023-04-30 10:26:28
"This game went from being really fun to even more grindy and competitive. Id say the worst part of these recent changes has been the changes to 2v2.

I always face players who are way too overleveled for the arena I'm in, and I always face players that have much fewer trophies than me, so I don't get anything out of winning. The matchmaking is a joke. Skill doesn't matter. Only levels do. The diamond pass is just a money grab. Like $12? Who would buy that? This game is so pay-to-win. I'd rather spend my time, money, and energy on a different game. Overall horrible game. 1 star.",1,2024-04-28 05:50:32
"This game is ultra fun and enjoyable most of the time but the one huge problem with this game is the pay to win of it even though me myself i do buy the pass every month, its still super unbalanced for lower trophy players.

Game is so pay 2 win now and its just terrible they dont nerf the people that needs it. Terrible game in general,1,2026-01-15 13:16:56
this game is full of people who enjoy the company of a man instead of a women and would rather play clash all day instead of human interaction.,1,2025-12-08 17:44:29
"Matchmaking is absolutely ridiculous and every update the devs make progression for free to play players worse and some cards are in need of emergency nerfs (prince, boss bandit) and the newer evolutions are all soulless cash grabs designed to be nerfed once many people buy it absolute joke of a game",1,2025-10-23 01:03:20
"This game is fun up until a certain point. What i experienced is that the game has horrible match making. For example, me being a level 10 player will be matched up against level 11 or even level 12 players. You have to get really lucky to beat players like this. Most of the time, the cards they use will be so much higher than yours its unbelievable. It makes it pointless to put up a fight. The smallest, cheapest cards will blow through your heavy troops like nothing. This needs to be fixed!",3,2021-07-11 03:27:53

"The game is fun I've have been playing this game since i was a child but throughout the years supercell have been making their games pay to win that that really takes the fun out of the game for me ""maybe for others too"" because you could have been grinding for a lone time to reach were you are just for someone else to reach were you are by jusy spending money and not actually playing the game and i feel that ain't fair for others like me.",2,2025-12-19 23:06:00

THE GAME SUCKS!!! The match making puts you with players that can counter your cards. You put in goblin Barrel in your deck and you go against players with log decks. They do this to make you think your deck is bad so you make a new one and SPEND MONEY ON THE GAME to upgrade your cards. It's all one big scam Edit: I came back after 2 years of not playing and it got worse. For anyone who thinks the game might be fun... its not.,1,2026-01-05 11:50:17

Going through stages of 7 or 8 wins followed by massive stints of losses as I'm paired up against almost identical opponents which my deck would struggle against. Enjoy the money supercell, you won't get another penny. Edit: These algorithms have since been confirmed to promote purchases. Disgusting.",1,2019-12-04 22:46:00

"I've been playing Clash Royale for years, but the game has become a shell of its former self. The constant push for monetization has turned it into a pay-to-win nightmare. The fun features that made the game engaging have been stripped away, leaving only frustration.Getting two evolution slots is now a Herculean task, and upgrading to level 15 feels like an insurmountable challenge. The game's design seems to actively discourage progression, instead encouraging players to spend money.",2,2024-10-02 19:28:18

If you want an enjoyable game and not have to be faced with unbalanced metas, ptp/ptw mechanics, and a genuine lack of heart, then i highly to play other games with devs that care. In fact, play any other SUPERCELL game for that matter. Being ftp sucks which makes you want to spend money. and that's all they care about. They are willing to trade every good idea for another chance to make more money.",1,2025-07-10 14:14:52

Although it has its fair share of glitch work...its original....for sure...and its tiresome at times. ..as constant battling can be...to mention very frustrating, when you lose crowns and trophies when it crashes...and it does happen often!

I'm a big gamer especially for the clash franchise. I can handle getting not kicked off the game here and there but for the past two weeks I've been getting kicked off 5 minutes or less. It's not a complex game if you guys can't fix these bugs I'm going to have let y'all go. I'm tired of losing points for losing battles that your system kicks me off of while the battle is ongoing...now I'm kicked in the middle of every battle. I'm done with yall,1,2023-09-16 05:34:57
i was in a middle of a game and i was winning but clash royale closed the app saying there was an update,1,2025-12-23 07:07:40
Terrible. I have had this game for five years and this game has turned terrible. I Hate going against players that have level 14 cards as a level 11 king tower. Also this game used to have but strategy to spam at the bridge. 0/0 don't get. Another thing is that this game is pay to win and if you don't have 200$ to spend you can't do anything really except grind and they want you to buy everything. Also people say I'm just bad but this game is the impossible to play unless you have lots of money.,3,2022-06-27 20:08:01
"It's pay to win all the way along with what seems like an algorithm controlling your wins and losses with a small win streak that the game seems to see and then give you impossible counter decks. along with that there is also the whole premium pass that gives you what the gold pass used to at a larger price tag. Take it from a guy that has been playing the game since launch, this game has severely declined.",1,2024-06-17 18:23:23

"What starts as a great game quickly turns into a pay to play/win. You will think you have a good set up, you will get 1 trophy away from the next arena. Then you will lose 7 matches in a row because it pits you against people 2 levels above you. Funny how you never face someone 2 levels below yourself.

New things like cards lvl 15 and ""evolutions"" are extremely slow to get if you don't pay one of their many passes or offers that are spammed daily on the shops at ridiculously high prices. At a certain level, you just stumble upon ennemies with all lvl 15 and evolutions which just gives an anormal advantage. What a downgrade this game has been through...",1,2025-09-21 16:36:16

Since this year I ran out of interesting enough big budget offline games to play, I decided to log back into clash royale which was my favorite game in high school, and man this game has also become the busting packs version of the supercell games.

"I've been playing for almost 10 years now and if you're looking for a highly skilled competitive game this is for you since it offer's different strategies and requires quick thinking, but the problem is when it comes to the game if you have not spent at least 20-40 dollars in diamond passes you will struggle A LOT due to the amount of rewards and how much it actually progresses players. Other than that the game is a 4/5 in my opinion.",4,2025-10-12 10:20:37
The magical tactics part is completely algorithm based its not in our control. Irrespective of the level or the stars of the cards the game will let you will or lose the battle. Even after getting hit it will increase the health of cards if it wants you to lose. if both the opponents have same card it will make the ones hit faster and the others slower if it wants to make you lose. waste part of the game. It just wants players to be online. waste of time uninstalling this game,1,2025-10-25 18:04:44
"I enjoyed the game more when I first started playing 9 yrs ago. Now, it has too much going on, cards are next to impossible to level unless you're paying rl cash, and while I'm playing against tower levels the same as mine their cards are over powered due to the now pay to win mechanics. Developers are updating the game to oblivion.",3,2025-10-10 05:58:59
"Once an absolute masterpiece has now been sucked bone-dry of any joy or passion. Clash Royale was always gonna be a game that wouldn't be peaking forever, but it's clear the game has been on life support for quite some time now. Constant new Pay2Win features mean that anything added or tweaked either overpowers everything or is utterly useless every week. I'd say I appreciate the continuous experimentation if they were actually unique and cool additions instead of painfully obvious cashgrabs.",2,2025-09-11 08:09:43
Nope yeah dead game. I officially give up and never coming back. Adding more levels so people spend is wild and completely stupid to be fair but you guys are used to this so I'm not surprised. The addition of what you guys called heroes was unnecessarily... say with me now stupid. So there's no value to this so called game if that's what you guys want to call it. It overall became an overwhelming casino where the ones who spend more win and I'm not for that. Hopefully the game ends this year.,1,2026-02-14 14:26:28
"It is, overall an excellent game that reminds me of chess a lot. Whether it be how you plan your attacks and defenses, or managing Elixer, card synergy and deck building. The main issue I have is, that it is at the end a Pay To Win game, especially mid ladder, as an F2P player, it really sucks having to fight cards way higher level than mine. So I mostly play the game with my friends and family now.",4,2025-08-28 21:07:30
There is too much network in this game due to which I get very angry. My phone has full network and full internet. Still I was winning while playing the match and suddenly the game crashes for 10 seconds and I lose. And this happens 4-5 times in a day. This is not right. Now I am deleting the game. Until this problem is fixed I will not play this game.,1,2025-08-28 19:51:43
"Pay to win. matchmaking so bad it helps paying players. Internet connection issues. Game mechanics work at random. Creativity is NOT advised as any deck except ""The 6 Meta Decks"" is just guaranteeing you'll lose. Overpriced in game purchases. Takes 10 years to achieve lvl 13 cards normally. Level 14 takes twice as long, and forget about 15. Only players left are more toxic than the alcohol keeping me sane. However, the gameplay is pretty fun. But i'm pretty sure cocain is less addicting.",1,2025-08-21 22:14:19
"I've played this game since it comes out, and the only consistent thing about it is that whoever spends the most money wins 90% of the time. when my pekka gets fully countered by 1 elixir skeletons, there's nothing you can do to win.

"This game has fallen from grace so hard. F2P players are in a state of limbo, in the way they're unable to progress in the game by any shape or form because this game caters more to P2W players. It is BAFFLING the amount of micro transactions there is. Imagine having to pay money just so you can compete with others. Do better devs.",1,2025-08-30 12:14:32
"This game stopped being fun after they hard pushed pay to win into the mix, you can get to the midgame without putting some money into the game but let me tell you. The current state of Competitive Yu-Gi-Oh is easier to play through than this. Unless this is the only game you plan to pay to grind harder than a Warframe player grinding for platinum when a new frame drops, don't look at this game.",1,2025-11-16 06:13:43
Worst game I've ever played. Once your done in the bot lobbies have fun winning more then one match a day the matchmaking will put you against the most obvious hard counters possible and to make it better they just continue to ruin what was a good game with removing the only way to get gold so unless you plan on spending lots of money to level anything up I suggest finding a different game if I could give this awful game less stars I would. -10/10 do NOT recommend,1,2025-09-01 22:49:14
Honestly a great game... if you have money. This game just heavily heavily encourages pay to win mentality because if you're f2p you'll be at a huge disadvantage every single match. This makes for a very frustrating and repetitive experience where some matches are lost from the beginning purely due to money difference. Great game though.,2,2025-09-22 18:09:51
"First off, when I came back I saw these loot boxes. now they are chests and that you have to tap and I quite like that idea and the game has purchase items that can help you upgrade your cards faster or get gold or whatever that's fine and all but don't for the love of God have an emote that is locked behind where you have to pay for it. I do not like that. I would prefer to get it through other means. easier means. It's gotten a little better but I'm above 9,000 trophies so I have no say",5,2025-10-16 01:44:15
"This game used to be phenomenal. Great graphics and smooth gameplay. Unfortunately, the game developers have chosen a more ""Pay to Win"" style, and gameplay shows. You work to upgrade cards in a deck and then battle other players' decks. If you're good, you'll level up quick and the rewards are aplenty. Unfortunately, no matter what you will find yourself at a skill cap where only those who spend $$$ get to progress, the infamous ""Mid-Ladder"". Be prepared for an experience full of highs and lows.",3,2025-08-26 22:16:13
"Finding a fair opponent in this game is nearly impossible. The matchmaking feels completely unbalanced, as if it’s deliberately set up against the player. No matter which deck you choose, the counter lineup appears instantly. I’ve decided to uninstall the game because of this lack of balance in matchmaking. It feels like playing is pointless, and honestly, it’s just a waste of time.Matchup❌️ 💩💩✅️",1,2025-10-03 08:27:34
The game used to be so good but now it feels really frustrating. It takes ages to increase the levels of the players without paying and no matter what deck you set for yourself the moment you win 2-3 battles they start giving the opponent which has players for which you either do not have defence or much higher level of yours.This used to be my only favourite game. I totally lost interest in the game. Uninstalled. Disappointed.,2,2025-10-07 00:30:51

Cant even enter the game its stuck at 75% on updating and after hours of trying different ways to fix the problem it didn't work so instead of trying to play this on my PC I tried on my phone once I got in after a month of playing I figured out the game is super pay to win either you pay or lose. do not recommend unless you have a bunch of money willing to spend or a couple years of consistant playing just to be as good as or worse than a play to win player.,1,2025-10-26 20:34:27
You will play with ai bots on trophy road it's obvious with the player name and their gameplay and when you get to higher trophy you will be matched with higher tower levels and card levels. You get a good match and then next game a total mismatch and get crushed by a player with high level cards and tower. Obviously it's a pay to win game. If you're planning to play it for free you'll just be stuck somewhere because of imbalance mismatches.,2,2025-08-31 11:47:38
I used to love the game so much which is why I give it four stars. It now has some pay to win advantages which sucks. The game was extremely fun and still is honest but a lot of the times I'm playing against people who started the game 3 years ago and have more lvl 15 cards and better cards leveled up compared to me. The gold also sucked it's almost impossible to get enough to upgrade the cards. I'm sitting at 9811 trophies and only have two lvl 15's but everyone I play has atleast six.,4,2025-11-08 06:43:00
"Used to enjoy this game alot. Everyone I knew played this game but over time everyone has left due to the pay to win experience. You simply end up in a loophole of winning a game, then loosing to an over leveled player 2 or 3 times. The only way I can see myself having any fun on this game is if I invest lots of money. You can no longer climb the ladder at a normal pace once you start reaching mid ladder. Don't reccommend.",1,2025-10-01 03:29:49
"I love what this game used to be. Overall great game, no bloatware and no ads. greatest mobile game of all time. however this game is pay to progress, the game intentionally matches you with hard counters and pass royale players so you dont win, get frustrated and buy their microtransactions. overall 1/5. love the concept but it's impossible to progress without swiping your credit card. I'd rather watch ads but have a playable game then an unplayable game with no ads.",1,2025-08-21 13:43:29
"game is unplayable without paying to win, it's fine in the beginning, but eventually, you hit a wall that you can not pass without dishing out truckloads of money. You eventually get matched against unbelievably bad players with even more unbelievably high-level decks that will stomp you just purely on stats no matter how well you play.",1,2025-10-20 19:06:29
It's too much frustrating for free to player. In my last 30 match i face 26 defeat. No matter what kind of deck i choose it will be ending at loosing. Maybe supercell want's free to player to leave thus they choose this kind of strategy. It was 9 year+ i am playing the game. But currently the match up they make for free to player is unbelievably frustrating. I think they should change their match making strategy or they will loos a lot of free to player.,1,2025-09-26 04:14:07
"Ladder matchmaking is straight up the worst thing ever created. if the game can't find an even match it will put you in an unwinnable matchup. The game has devolved into wallet wars.

It's not enough that trophy road is full of overleved players always playing the annoying current meta, they also changed events to also reflect the player's card level, so if you're a free to play player with level 12-13 cards at 7300 trophies you'll be facing enemies with all cards level 15 and evos",1,2025-08-24 13:54:27

You definitely can get through the game quick if you only used money which sucks but it's still a good game and you're able to progress without using money, it's just WAYYY slower without it.",4,2025-09-16 00:43:01
"I used to love Clash Royale, but it’s become frustrating to play. The matchmaking feels completely unfair, pay-to-win cards dominate, and updates don’t fix the real problems. Progressing without spending money takes forever, and the fun, balanced gameplay it once had is gone. Really disappointing from a game that used to be great.",1,2025-10-18 23:04:04
"Dogshit game that is pay to win no matter where you are in the game. Dont worry, wait 5 years and you too as free to play player can have 3 lvl 15s compared to mr.credit card that has all his cards maxed and you get to play them every other game if not every game. GOODLUCK!!!! Best part is watching a knight kill a 7 elixir pekka bc he has 5 more levels than you 🤡🤡🤡🤡. Uninstalled unless they make the game easier for free to play without having to put countless hours and still have nothing....",1,2025-09-30 07:06:05
"returner experience sucks. Used to love to play this game years ago, decided to come back and try it and at first it was fun and fresh but once you hit mid ladder its all just depending if you spent money or not. Card and tower level difference is horrible, you can't have access to EVOs at all because you need 6 SHARDS FOR ONE (for reference it took a week to get one free from the battlepass). Still a horrible game when I left.",1,2025-09-06 20:15:10
"In merge tactics, some times the troops slots are showing blank. I lost many times, only because the slots to select the troops was showing empty.

"This game is simply unplayable if you go free-to-play after a certain amount of time. Since you simply can't keep up with the people who spend money on the game, I played against a player who only had an Evolved Electric Dragon in Arena 6, and that damn card is only obtainable in Arena 12. Congratulations, Supercell, you managed to ruin a game that was actually a strategy game and was fun for a game of: Whoever spends the most money on the game wins.",1,2025-09-25 12:51:11
"pay to win, that's it. if you dont pay, you ain't winning. the game likes to give out wins to people who give money. I have been playing for a while, and the only thing I see is if you dont pay, you are not winning. supercell never fixes the problem they just keep going to make t he free to play change to pay for the game. I have friends who said that if you dont pay, you're not going over 5000 trophies",1,2025-09-26 11:48:48

Not really anything good to say other than it's ok as a last resort time killer. now I'm seeing they added winstreaks.. what's the point in keeping track of wins in a game that has absolutely zero to do with skill because it's full of bots and games are rigged?",1,2025-10-06 20:10:53
i had a lot of fun at first but as you progress every player pays money for the game and it is impossible to win as players just pay and their towers and cards destroy yours as they are só over levelled and it is no fun for players who cant pay for the game. you can sit there and play for 3 hours straight and lose progress as it is virtually impossible and unfair when you play against players who pay a lot of money for the game,1,2025-08-23 00:03:54

"this game is genuinely impossible to play at low tier, for example, occasionally you get a easy player to go up against, most of the time, you go up against players that have over leveled cards use broken/unbeatable cards and can't counter them without being in higher tier, genuinely the worst mobile game that I've ever played.",1,2025-08-26 03:44:37
"Do NOT install this game unless you enjoy spending insane amounts of money on a mobile game just to compete w/others, at a certain point you will not be able to progress since it takes ages to level a card and all your opponents have higher levels than you, and dont get me started on clan wars, it's pay wars, everyone there is max level, no point in playing this game, i suggest just watching YouTubers who are are p2w play the game, that's the only way to get enjoyment out of this game for free",1,2025-10-04 19:36:48

The game is already degrading enough because of all these stupid changes, like removing the chests, the season shop, adding stupid evolutions, instead of making the game player friendly, you people are cutting off our (players') chances to make progress a little bit easily. The game's fun and enjoyment is reducing with each day.",1,2025-09-07 23:05:30
The game became so pay to win dependent If you don't pay in your account you can't compete especially when you start playing in 4000 to 9000 trophy. My account is 7 years old and i still don't have a complete deck Because every time i choose a deck and start leveling it up they launch some new overpowered card or i hit a new lvl of trophys that i have to change my entire deck wich means i have to lvl the new deck and it's impossible without paying so much money. Plus there is balance problems.,1,2025-09-27 15:53:46
"Bad matchmaking, I tried to push to higher arenas yet im limited because both my cards and towers have 2-3 levels below my opponent on top of my opponent sometimes having evolution cards. Hard to play without paying money in lower ladders. I feel cheated because if it wasn't for the level difference and evolutions I felt I could have won most matches. I don't mind if others pay for better cards but at the very least don't match them with players who don't pay. Playing casually used to be fun.",1,2025-11-03 11:44:12
"Having been on and off this game since launch I can confirm it just sucks, it's not fun unless you pay $12 a month because the algorithm specifically places high spenders against lower leveled players who don't spend as much.

I was excited at first, but after about a month, I can say with certainty - its just broken and a poor mimicry of what it used to be even just 3 years ago. my justification for that claim is this- unlike how it was before 2022, the game now limits the reward you get by the day. 5 limited chests, lousy crown rewards. if you play free- you are stuck.",1,2025-10-12 09:37:30

"I have been playing this game since 2022, and it was fun at that with just some minor problems but after some recent changes specially in 2025 developers just made it a pay to win game. You get matched with players way higher level and evolved cards there is just no way to win, it was a skill based game back then but not anymore. Supercell is definitely a good game developers as I also play COC they doing good in that game but they are just loosing players in this one after being greedy.",1,2025-09-21 16:50:02
"The worst game I have played from supercell , it's so pay to win you can't even play rank at this point, and if you go a bit higher the matchmaking always gives you over level players like there is no chance to win , i thought to play for fun but it's so depressing to play it's not even worth the effort, you know you are gonna loose. and anyways it's a dead game afterall, they don't want new players i guess atleast the hierarchy seems that way",1,2025-09-28 14:20:05

"This game is good. It has a bunch of cards to collect and its really fun and addictive. But there is one major problem, during tournaments, it should be made so that all card levels and king tower levels are the same because if you are just level 8 and your opponent is level 10, his king tower and princess tower would have more health and do more damage. Cards would be like that as well. So i really hope they fix this issue but other than that everything is good.",3,2020-07-13 16:10:30

I definitely recommend this game to people who like games like Clash of Clans, as they are both made by Supercell.

The game concept is good. But Supercell is the worst by making it as a pay-to-win. Every season they make some cards as overpowered as they like and sell in-game purchases and from the very next season they nerf those cards. If you are a free2play player then do not play it. They ruined the game and may ruin you too.,2,2025-11-14 20:19:29

"game is fun and awesome, however I shouldn't be fighting people from arena 10 while I am only arena 4, unacceptable in any PvP game",2,2025-12-01 03:28:15
its an amazing game but that it is a pay to win kinda makes it unfair.,4,2025-12-27 23:34:11
Never thought supercell would disappoint us like this !! Pay To Win !! You've earned money but the respect is gone and the OG public is gone !! Never going to play the game again !!,1,2025-12-22 06:10:43
"Merge Tactics is 5 stars, a little bare bones but still great little time waster. I don't care for the main game anymore too pay to win",5,2025-09-01 20:22:42
this game is fun but the problem is the arena number 18 is so hard like I spent 3 years on it and I can't finish it I am just not able to have fun cuz I'm so bored in my arena pls make it easier like make everyone that have anything lvl 15 be at least lvl 13 in arena 18 only pls I'm so bored in it,5,2025-09-26 03:26:05

Simply my favorite game forever!!! 👏🏾😍 And then... I'm playing again!!! What can I say about ""tactical combinations""?!?!?! I'm F***king addicted!!! Now that I learned how really PLAY this new game, I felt the same feeling from the commercial!!! 😲🤯 You guys, SUPERCELL GENIUS, ARE SIMPLY THE BEST!!! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾",5,2025-08-30 12:49:16

Played this game before also And now also I am playing... before 2024 it was soo much better... now the updates are very frequent and also cards are bad....,5,2025-11-24 19:18:45
The game is great and would be 5 stars if they didn't put you against bots with a hard counter deck a few times.,4,2025-11-25 00:29:52
i love the characters i love the gameplay and i love how its just fun,5,2026-02-14 23:24:56
there is a bot march other wise there was an bug whether you win one match in next match there was moder game play you loss 2 match then you play another match you will again loss the match this is game where you waste your time other wise your energy because of the losing game no one have to play this game after all we have other choice. this game is not bad at all but there was a noob match where you want to play you have to loss first and then you started playing game for much time thankyou,1,2025-11-19 20:31:09
really good need to make an account though otherwise you will be logged out but fun dont like the updates but fun to play with mates,4,2025-11-25 17:58:16
TBH I had a lot of fun as a f2p until they added hero's and level 16 and making it easy for people who pay to get evos im gonna be honest you ruined your game supercell.,1,2026-01-17 09:41:30
Rewriting this review because there is a lot to talk about. First we have level 15. That was the most horrible decision by Supercell ever. After that there were the evolutions which at the time of release were completely unbalanced and gamebreaking. Then of course we can't forget about the season shop removal which fans are to this day demanding back. Which brings us to now where supercell decides to finally address the EWC problem by adding a whole new level. This game is horrible please avoid,1,2025-11-21 06:28:51
"Super mid, really low effort, boring, and trying to be addictive. Am only playing because friend forced me to",3,2025-11-20 21:18:31

The game is good but there are many P2W assets. Recommend making progression easier for F2P players.,4,2025-11-30 20:37:41
balance your game (this game is too payto win) (if you dont balance it it will become dead in a few months i like this game but i run into too much payto win players i admit i suck but its really often i suggest listening to players about new updates that we want,1,2025-11-23 17:17:01

This game is just a money grab and when you play a match you go against 4 different decks it literally gets worse every update,1,2025-11-22 06:57:20
This game is stupid. Got to arena 17 6740 trophies then I just go up against 5 pay to win players in a row. Supercell your game is terrible.,1,2025-12-07 02:11:50

The game is super fun although it p2w sometimes other wise i have had a good time with it the hero update is gonna be cheeks tho i would recomend using hog 2.6 its the best balenced deck,4,2025-11-25 03:24:08
very good game but sometimes is pure ragebait but overall it's a very good game and it needs internet to be able to play.,5,2025-11-19 13:28:36
I am extremely disappointed. I cannot recover old account after spending much time and $$. I will gladly retract my comment if account is recovered.,1,2025-11-05 07:29:56
used to be a fun game. pay to win and completely insufferable now. whoever developed this game should retire and never touch coding again.,1,2025-11-24 00:59:29
this is going to be the worst update in the games history there is no reason to bring hero's to the game you had such a good game and you ruined it instantly,1,2025-11-25 02:39:03

"This game is impossible to play competitively if you are f2p, I had rounds where all my cards were Level 13 and my opponent had a complete level 15 dec, the matchmaking is absolutely horrendous, not even talking about evos, which are way too hard to get, if you are f2p you'll need about 2 months to unlock an evo, which are essential to the game. I still played the game even though it was at that described state, but this new update threw everything out of proportion, level 16 has to be a joke.👎",1,2025-11-25 04:42:24

this game does not have a stop thing to confirm if you want to do this. i jusy lost 100 gems because i didnt see it. i wish this game cound have that with the new heroic update,1,2025-11-24 00:40:34

"Very much a pay to win game. You cannot keep up if you dont. King tower levels have are a major factor in the result and somehow the game cant manage to match you with similar trophies and king tower players.... also on challenges, you'll also be matched against players who have been playing way longer, sometimes 1-2k higher in trophies. All designed not to allow none spending players to progress as far. Its the reason even the top players who have maxed their accounts still spend money.",1,2021-03-30 17:13:27

It was fun while it lasted but it's pretty repetitive now. New clan wars 2 match making is trash. Every player you face is level 13/maxed out cards or has 1k more trophies. Clan wars also forces you to be active 24/7 and promotes a toxic environment. The game is no longer casual friendly. Their strategy is to cause frustration so you throw money in to the game. Guess it's time to finally uninstall this after 4 years. I would also suggest people not to buy the pass anymore.,2,2020-09-22 12:55:46

That button is gone. 4. It is shifted as far as away possible from the accessibility. 5. I can't grind masteries with 2v2 anymore. Level cap makes it much more harder to get faster masteries done. 6.

"This was one of my favorite games to play for many years but several issues have caused me to quit. The trade system is broken after recent update. In a clan with many near max players trading used to be common. We would even trade for cards we don't want just to help each other. Trades used to last about one hour in chat. After the update next to no one will trade except for cards they need. We now have 41 trade offers available that no one will accept because they don't want to use a trade token. An easy fix would be to remove the requirement of needed a trade token to accept trades. Another major issue is you can over-level your cards. By focus only on upgrading your deck you can be a level 10 with level 13 commons. This can break balance as they will face level 10s with level 10 commons and destroy them. The easy way to fix this would be to cap card levels at their king level. Of course with an exception for the first two or three card levels. I do hope you take these issues and possible fixes into consideration. If these changes are made then this game could become a fantastic game with much less frustration involved. Thank you for your time, Gizmoman64",2,2018-12-15 03:48:17
"I love playing the game, but the matches on ladder are sometimes very unbalanced; I can face max level units while I'm using level 10 or 11 cards. You should make matchmaking based on a points system where each level of a card in your deck is added up to match other players, thus making a very fair game. however i dont like the fact the pass costs money, why cant it just cost 500 gems?",3,2021-10-28 04:36:18
"Game is awful. Most of the time you'll lose just because someone has more upgraded cards then you meaning they have been playing long. Cards are broken and the game is so slow paced, it takes 20 years just to get a single elixir sadly. overall this game is fun actually when you're a high level. I wanted to come back to this game at first because the game looked fun on YouTube. But nevermind....",1,2018-10-11 09:39:54
micro transactions are getting more and more ridiculous.,3,2025-12-02 22:00:07
"Problem is I keep getting higher level opponents or opponents with higher level card even though im not under leveled. Even if I upgrade anything, it seems that it will automatically give me higher leveled opponents compared to mine. This happens 90% of my matches and it's just not fun anymore. Feels they are baiting me to spend money in order upgrade.",2,2025-11-09 10:03:39
Good game and I love it. but can u not match the low level with a high level and player with card 1 or 2 level away,2,2025-10-20 22:34:02
"the new update sucks, the game is pay to win, alot of cards are brocken, you will randomly get losing streaks",1,2025-12-17 07:34:00
"It's fun, it's free. Even though she people but power ups, is never really effected my ability to have fun and lost lots of matches. There's a lot to the game that's a little non intuitive but that just adds to the fun. The game has rts aspects which can be stressful but because the games are short it keeps things fun. I wish there was a give up option sometimes for when I'm losing badly and cannot get back in the game.",5,2022-06-28 08:12:44
"I hate how you don't get an equal opportunity with the same cards. I hate going into new arenas and getting swarmed by cards I've nev3r even seen or had just so obv pay to win. The game doesn't care about the community just cash and never nerfs the right cards. how does boss bandit have the same amount of health as Pekka practically, yet cost less?",1,2025-12-10 04:11:54
ive been playing since 2017 at the beginning it was fun but now its nothing but a pay to win game and people only spam one card with emote constantly making the game now all about who can spend money,1,2025-10-30 22:19:19
best game ever when i see archer queen it makes me go crazy.,5,2025-12-14 08:53:49
the game is fun but after a certain point it just becomes an annoying mess that brings you more pain than enjoyment.,1,2025-10-27 04:11:08
its a good game for the first bit but once you get to the higher arenas the game starts feeling trash,3,2026-01-06 09:04:36
love playing this game great when you at the airport or somewhere where you just want the time to pass by,5,2025-12-19 04:21:41
this game is really fun to play on long boring road trips and while sitting in your grandma's basement at a sleepover because that's the coolest place to be so I would recommend this game to everyone I know this game is so much fun that I cannot stop playing it since my cousin forced me to get it,5,2025-10-12 08:16:31
"Very much love the game. However, ever since returning after 2 years, I've been disappointed to see how gready the game has turned and how much of a pay-to-win, money grab it's become since I lasted played. This review stands until the developers and management of Supercell LISTENS TO THE COMMUNITY and makes proper change for the community as a hole.",1,2023-06-27 14:44:52

For people that want to play the game here are all the reasons I deleted Clash Royale after the NEW update: 1) Duplicates at max level now turn into cosmetics 2) Nerfed lucky drops are awful 3) Progression is impossible 4) Heros just downgrade all the evos I've worked hard for 5) The gem economy is awful. 6) Level 16 in itself is ridiculous All of this to say that I refuse to spend any money on the game so I deleted it.,1,2025-12-12 01:05:05
Turn into a pay 2 win game. But overall I'll say it average,3,2025-12-19 00:01:46
"This game used to be good now it is absolute TRASH. The new update is riddled with bugs. It doesn't matter how strong my internet connection is, there are still delays lasting over 2 seconds. The game feels much slower, much more clunky. When I hit 2x or 3x elixer, my deploys actually end up SLOWER. All around trash experience.",1,2020-01-18 09:02:34
Just a Ok video game but it's just that it so pay to win! WHY supercell why. WHY DID U RUIN THIS BEAUTIFUL GAME. 🥲😐,2,2026-01-03 16:46:08
"Honestly, this game always had the problem of being pay to win. If you win alot, you have to fight overleveled players. The developer team has completely abandoned the game. The new update is not satisfing enough because the community has been waiting for over a year for it and it isn't even coming out until 2 months. I love the game but being a free to play on it is so frustrating because if a card in your deck gets nerfed, you have to find a new deck and level it up again which takes years.",1,2020-07-10 10:07:58
"It's a great game with its only problems being some balancing issues. Edit: After two years of not playing the game, I came back only to find the balance of the game far worse and with level 14 cards, it basically locks you into one deck and you can never switch off without being at an absurd level advantage",1,2021-12-26 09:32:02
"after playing this game for just about 10 years, it is nothing what it used to be. you have so many things that you now force people to pay for that you just don't give away as regularly. so now every single time it comes up in the rewards section you get sweaty aha kids where legitimately this game means absolutely everything to them and it's like wow. so there is no fun playing this game anymore unless you spend thousands of dollars why would I spend thousands of dollars to play a game",1,2025-11-28 00:23:04
"Absolutely brain dead Devs that ruin the game just for a couple extra bucks. Would not recommend playing this completely broken and imbalanced excuse of a game, which is a shame because this game was something special and they had to go and ruin it for the sake of revenue.",1,2026-02-13 08:36:36
"With each update, the game becomes progressively worse! I'm an og player, and have seen the game descend into a cash grab. It's pathetic to play anymore, and there's no real fun reward in playing. New evolutions or cards are very broken, and get nerfed into oblivion.",1,2025-09-06 13:56:01
"The game itself is fun and a great concept. However, the company who operates the game (Supercell) are money grabbing fiends. They do not care about pay to win or taking your money. They consistently come out with broken cards that require people to spend 10-30 dollars to get. Then they take this card and make it obsolete. Most recent is vines. I have no way to progress right now because I am a level 13 king tower with only half my deck level 14 and my opponents all have 15 or 14 minimum.",1,2025-09-08 09:45:38
"That was a great game! However, I find myself leaving due to the ""Mega Knight"" 💔 card. It disrupts the original feel of the game, as it is an overwhelmingly powerful card that I encounter frequently in battles, and defending against it seems impossible 😑. Farewell, I quit 😕!",1,2025-09-09 02:21:19
I mean it's only level 14 and 15 cards that I face and I only have level 12 and 13 cards but the gameplay is really fun so it's a good game a little to p2w,4,2025-10-17 04:16:42
it has to many updates that literally don't affect the game at I had like 3 updates in 3 days and now I can't finish updating the last one it's fun af but do better,3,2025-10-23 08:38:39
You guys seriously need a report a player option! There are hackers! Even in your q & a search bar there is no option! I'm getting sick of some of these players getting away with obvious damage mods and not being able to report it! At least once or twice a week now I'm coming across some players that have damage dealing mods you need to have this option available for fair play!,1,2024-05-31 08:15:07

this game is really great its about you finding different strategies and building decks but it's something bad about this great game . it's that players are most times overleveled and they pay so much. in countries like in Iran with 1 US dollar you can buy 4 BAG OF CHIPS WITH IT.so it's offers are so expensive 😫,4,2025-12-15 16:42:05
it's a great game but the only thing is the losing trophies if you lose a game I keep winning a game but keep being put back to 2000 trophies,5,2025-10-04 18:13:24

"The July update had made this game unplayable. The game had crashed more than a dozen times in the past few days since I updated. It crashes midgame, it crashes opening chests, and it crashes navigating the menus, especially when trying to access the shop. The new season pass would be kind of nice IF THE GAME WAS PLAYABLE!!!",1,2019-07-06 11:36:39
The game was great but new updates have made the game so pay to win,1,2026-01-15 09:35:24

clash royale is getting to pay to win plead clash royale stop the pay to win it is getting annoying and you guys just focus on adding heros or giving evos to other cards clash royale stop the pay to win also nerf some cards 🙄 there so over powerd that you can't do stuff against stuff so please do stuff to stop the pay to win it's really bad,3,2026-01-02 10:23:03

"There are so many different cards already with new ones being released constantly, that any upgrades have now been made near impossible. Add to that no lvl cap on arenas where you are endlessly matched against max lvl players and cards that make winning nearly impossible even for good players. Throw in the introduction of evos and heroic cards theyve now introduced, that you can really only acquire with pass royale or in the shop. PAY TO WIN!",1,2026-01-03 22:13:40
"Yes, it's a good game I'll say but it slowly turns into a more pay to win game with all of the bundles and game passes today. With all of that it's feel impossible to play and win without buying anything. That all I have to say about it and i will say it again it a good game wish they can go back when there wasn't alots of bundles and game passes and make it hard to gain any resources without buying, but hey if you like to challenge yourself and try to win against the paying players go ahead👍",3,2024-12-13 23:15:52
"Really good game, really enjoyable to play. I love the clan system because we can donate or trade cards whilst also working together in card collection challenges and clan wars as a team, where every attack matters. My only complaint, is that level 1 accounts are not able to participate in clan wars at all, nor can they donate cards or trade. I would love to see this added and hope that I can use my level 1 account to support the clan. It's a fun challenge and I want to do more with my level 1.",4,2020-04-15 01:41:55
played the game since drop and it's just awful. no matter what play to play always wins you can't win if you don't pay $100's+ and the gameplay is so mid and repetitive especially when you make it to 10000+ no one is original or can think for themselves to make a deck and it becomes boring and aggravating. not worth investing your time or money,1,2025-08-28 09:45:25
"solid game, fun to play even when all the slots are full of chests. liking how much patches, tournaments, and updates it gets but if I'm already playing on data then your game should have to wait to reload. it switches to wifi and I gotta go through the loading screen and wait for it to load my current game where my opponent/s won because I'm not playing for those few moments. I've lost countless battles because of it.",4,2019-07-08 07:36:09

its a nice game but one win then i get over leveled guys up against me. like one single good game then its back to zero because supercell wants to be a pain in the butt. Honestly supercell you should know better than that. (edit) once i hit king tower level 12. i get P2W players every single game with cards lvl 12+ while i still have cards that are under 10. fix yo shi supercell. for a finnish app yall should do better,2,2025-10-10 04:54:58
"Great game, and really recommend it. I've deleted this game several times, due to the space it takes up or bordism. I love how every Sunday you get a chest, I understand stand why you might not like it but, if you've never played this game, you should check it out, it's worth the space. However, it's not offline, none of it is, I mean couldn't we sort our cards out or do training? But honestly you should try this game, it's great! In",5,2019-10-22 19:43:42

"Honestly, this is really interesting and strategy game. I have been playing this game since 1 year with my friends and I'm at level 10. There are lots of cards with different abilities, we have to learn how and when to use right card. It's required more time to perfect it but, as much as u play u will get more interested. Sometimes, low 8 level player get 12 or 13 level player against them it's quite disappointing but beside that it's a good game. So play 2v2 to master it and to try your decks.",4,2021-03-30 18:27:24
I think u should delete your game. Because it's of no use that higher level player always wins the match. As you always makes the match with higher level player and make us loss and force us to buy your pass royale etc. And then u will be able to win. What was this. I basically I also play in starting I won 1 match but after that continueuosly I lose 7 matches in a row. The reason was either higher level troops or network connection. Solve this problem or either delete the game forever.,1,2021-03-02 10:08:45

very fun to play but at this point it's just pay to win. Clash royal used to be about skill now it's just about spamming Maga knight until you win.,3,2025-09-09 22:15:03
I'm an og been playing since it first came out and tried getting back into the game and I'm quite disappointed. For starters the matchmaking is pretty bad so bad in fact that if you win one game they pin you up against people with high level cards and cards you don't even have. And then begins the losing streak you'll lose tons of trophies so that arena you've been grinding to reach yep not gonna happen. In short summary they try to make you pay to win and if you don't you practically can't win.,2,2022-11-30 02:27:57
"It used to be a fun game, but the new update ruins everything. Before, the pass was 5 dollars. now there are 3 tiers, and the top tier isnt nearly as good as the original pass royale. it feels like they obviously dont care about their players, and it seems like money is more important to them then the actually game. Also, the game is now VERY pay to win. I hope they remove update or soemthing",1,2023-04-11 02:52:15
"The developers greed on this one is beyond what anyone would think is possible. The challenges are made so that on your free try you counter most people who are doing their second or third, and then once you lose and they make you pay gems you're gonna win no more than 1 per 100 gems. it's sickening how you'll get to choose between bats and minions while enemy gets to pick between hogs and ice spirit. Rigged just to milk every little dollar out of you, sickening.",1,2025-10-11 14:15:07
"If you're an unoriginal person and wanna play the same decks someone has been playing for years, then this is the game for you. If you want to not see the same decks with the same cards all the time, then move on.

"Like many are saying this is a pay to win game and even if you are the most skillful player you can't compete with others without paying. So I decided like others to buy one of their offers in order to help my play.

"Love this game. The ability to customize tower skins is great, and evolving cards is good, too. However, I find it difficult that I am restricted to the king tower and princess towers.

I used to really enjoy this game. The concept of it is really fun but there are way too many people that have figured out how to cheat the game. They'll play several high elixir cards way too close together while you're still waiting to gain enough elixir to play one defense card. The only way this game is enjoyable anymore is if we play solely within our own clans. This game will be exceptionally more fun if they can get the cheaters under control.,2,2022-06-25 09:32:34

Even bought the royal pass and it's going to waste cause can't even play the game. Every single acct I've had has been nothing but bad. So disappointed in this game and the updates. Waste of Money buying the pass. The newest update some nothing either. Idk what bugs your fixing caus sits not fixing anything. No stars for this game.

"Clash Royale has been a letdown for me over the past two weeks. No matter how much I play, I'm stuck at the same rank without any improvement. The game feels unfair because it often matches me against much better players. It seems like spending money matters more than skill. Progressing in the game doesn't feel rewarding, and it's just frustrating. Overall, Clash Royale has been a disappointment, especially for players like me who want a fair and enjoyable gaming experience😡😡😡",1,2023-12-13 03:00:35

"Balancing is bad, the matchmaker puts you against hard counter decks until you buy something in the game except when the season is about to end to make you buy the next pass by making it harder on the start of the new season.

Used to be good until they added Mega Knight now everybody uses him and its really annoying. its pay to win after 7500 trophies. BTW Mega Knight is crazy op and really only has a few counters so everyone that payed money used it on MK and his evolution which makes him even more op. just doesn't feel fun anymore and I've played this game off and on for 6 plus yrs. bad balance from the devs.,2,2025-11-12 01:11:10
I've played this game on and off for the last 8 years and came back last month. I am at 9914 trophies and I can say It's absolutely terrible now. Unbalanced cards. Pay to win evolutions. You have to have a PhD in war strategies and F1 driver reflexes to even enjoy your experience. Do not install. This game fuels brain rot.,1,2025-12-23 15:45:03

"This game is unbelievably perfect. It's taken me 2 years to get where I'm at. I understand other comments say the matchmaking is poor, but the game is based on tiers. The better you play, the higher tier you get. So, you can expect to end up being matched against players who are higher level than you the higher you get. It's strategy-based, so if you suck at strategy games, this isn't the one for you. Also, if your clan isn't that active, you need to find a new one. My clan always wins clan wars",5,2020-11-18 19:13:14

The game has been ruined.",1,2025-12-04 11:07:31

"People say the matchmaking is based on win or loss streaks, but I have to disagree majorly. Be ready to fall in love with this game early on and then hate it as you play. I go on losing streaks more than winning streaks in the high 5000s for trophy range. As I'm typing this I just went 3/13 on my recent matches.

Gone are the days when this game was fair and square. It has got an algorithm which makes you play it for longer hours. You will win the 3 matches and then you will definitely lose minimum of the next two matches. Those who invest in the game can get champions irrespective of their arena. EVERYTHING IS ABOUT THE MONEY NOW. You can play it if you do not wish to progress in the next arena. The developers are too tired to fix this game now or progress this game that they are just poaching money..,1,2024-04-22 20:21:57
"The game is totally fair, as all players can get the same cards and create the same 'decks', but in an advanced form of Rock, Paper, Scissors there is no real 'best deck'. Some cards use more elixir points, meaning they are more powerful at a greater cost per play, so you have to select 8 cards and then decide when and where to play them in combination, depending largely on how your opponent plays and what cards you are against. Will your opponent have a Rock, or Paper deck to your Scissors?",5,2021-03-31 01:29:14
READ RECENT REVIEWS. TOTAL RATING IS NOT ACCURATE. I've spent money on this game to see if it makes a difference and it does but very marginally. They will let you win the first game you log into for the day then pair you up with the perfect counter teams almost indefinitely to try and get you to pay more for upgrades that you can only get by spending money. AVOID THIS GAME.,1,2023-12-20 23:00:13

"$40 FOR A STACK OF CARDS! After trying the game again to see if I can fall in love with it. not only do they have so many new cards that they are unable to manage a fair play. Every season they come out with a new card that out does the rest of the cards that you own, and the only way to get that new card is by spending $40 for the stack. Only for that new card to get nerfed to make room for the new card in the new season. 😂 Insane!",1,2025-08-30 20:14:19
"The connection to the servers keeps breaking, even if you are sitting right next to the router or have a full mobile netreception The game is the most annoying game I have ever played The misuse of the game and the horribly annoying players (most of them are children or playing like children) have dragged the game to its lowest level No Fair play And I don't see any future for it I am so Annoyed and frustrated at the lack professional gameplay I deleted it and I don't recommend it to anyone",1,2020-09-17 04:40:13

it used to be a simple and really fun strategy game but it's become so ptw it's hard to compete with people who spend a lot of money on the game. I had gotten my first lvl 15 card and a month later they release lvl 16 cards. just hard to keep up as a ftp player in high ranks,2,2025-12-05 21:56:14

the only good thing about this game is that it doesn't take money to install. But if you are not willing to spend money in ingame purchases this game is definitely not for you as the gameplay is highly dependent on leveling up buying chests using gems from the shop. To max out your account it will probably take more than a thousand dollers.

"⭐☆☆☆☆ Extremely unfair and frustrating game. Clash Royale matchmaking is not based on skill at all. It matches players based on card levels, king level, and playtime instead of merit. The game gives you 1–2 easy wins and then forces you into 10+ consecutive losses against overpowered opponents. This is clearly designed to create frustration and addiction, not fun. New players should avoid installing this game — it wastes time, energy, and peace of mind.",1,2026-01-22 23:02:52
Very addictive. It used to be a great game. I just can't believe how they keep increasing delays on things and weakening game pieces. I see they want PAY TO WIN so they make more money but it has really gotten rediculous! It costs $5/mo to play so be ready for that. DON'T BOTHER PAYING FOR STUFF because they will just mess up that player in a few months and add a new one to try to get you to pay for.

Game prioritises profit above all else.

"now with the new update free2play players have to suffer again seeing their logs not kill dart goblins and princesses, and now even more pay2win super evolutions coming out to mess up the game. when the hype of this game dies out , this will be the next game that will be shut down by supercell",1,2025-11-25 23:18:51
"The recent updates have been terrible and just a cash grab by supercell. It's sad to see it turn into a pay-to-win game from one of my favourites back in the day. Seriously , the level 15 update is a huge disappointment , which no once asked for. And asking $100 for evolutions is just ridiculous and cheap from the developers. Instantly deleted the game.",2,2023-06-27 19:16:08

Clash Royale has been a very fun game throughout the years but the problem is that it has become much more of a pay to win friendly game and every matchup you'll find yourself battling overlevelled opponents.,3,2025-09-23 14:06:06

"I know it's been said for many games that ""oh it used to be good but the last update ruined it,"" But in this case, Clash Royale has seen such a depressing, slow and steady decline it saddens me to even open the game. every update, every season, every small patch buries this once great game deeper in its own grave. each new patch removes necessary features, replacing them with broken cards that result in a pay-to-exist scenario every single match. Current clash is a disgrace to what it once was.",1,2025-12-25 21:48:59

"I remember playing this game a year after it released and how fun it was back then. However, I've recently downloaded it again only to uninstall it after seeing how absolutely p2w it's become. It's a shame to see such a good game be reduced into another corporate cash grab instead of remaining passionate about their game, which ultimately ruined it since how in the world is it fair for a new player to try winning against someone with already lvl 10 or higher cards? Shame on you, Supercell.",1,2025-09-22 04:08:40
"fun game if you just remove the level difference between you and your opponent, p2w ash, unbalanced cards, and pay to win as hell, either you win by being over leveled or losing because your opponent is over leveled",2,2025-10-11 11:19:50
pay to win absolutely B.S. game. wouldnt be terrible if you weren't matched against players that ARENT your tower level? how are you supposed to progress when you're being paired against people whose cards LITERALLY are better in every way,1,2025-09-20 20:39:51
"This game used to be fun. The matchmaking is not really fair in the sense that you will get put up against people with fully maxed out cards and a LVL 13 tower when you are only an 11 or 12 with your highest cards being 11 or possibly 12. They also added a new level, but dropped people 4 levels in some cases due to the points system change. Not worth it anymore!",3,2021-06-08 09:03:56
"Use to be addicted to this game, but now it's aweful. Even if you max your cards, all they do is raise the level cap so you have to re-upgrade everything. They have done this 3 times now. It's stupid and pointless (other than supercell clearly after the cash grab). It's actually one of the most blatently greedy things Ive seen in a game and the reason I stopped spending money on it. And playing it all together.",1,2023-07-17 13:09:14
"The clan wars used to be pretty good. As a lower level player I still had options that allowed me to have an even playing field where regardless of our actual level and cards we were made the same level with same level cards. Loved this game (and I'll still play a bit) but I can't stand getting set up against players two levels higher than me with better cards. Worse yet, I haven't seen many clans actually finish the clan wars to get the better prize. (Their fix did nothing)",1,2020-11-20 04:25:08

"I redownloaded this game because I used to actually enjoy it. It used to be a somewhat balanced and very fun game that rewarded you for patience and never matched you up against someone who outclasses you by vast amounts. But I played this game for all of 5 minutes before it became painfully obvious that unless I wanted to spend money to make the game so easy it wouldn't be fun, I wasn't going to win a single game regardless of strategy or skill.

It was once the best games on the app store, and rightfully so. But then the devs got greedy, they needed more money, and now Its just another pay to win game that took advantage of it's fanbase, I used to love this game, but now it's just unfair to all the honorable players who have spent countless hours grinding to the top.

Its a really nice game. I have been playin for 3 to 4 years now on different phones and accounts. But like all other games it has some issues . The more u play u kinda get frustrated as most of the times especially in events it will match u with much higher leveled players and even the downloading of the recources takes too much space and time. The opening of chests also get too long to open. I would appreciate it if there would be an opportunities to decreae the time to open chests.itsnotall;,3,2021-05-21 00:17:42

This made me depressed because players just keep spamming things like mega knight and supercell is just money hungry they release an evo and nerf it This isn't a game this is a trap making you buy fictional things for your opponents spams mega knights.(I will never forgive you supercell I almost did suicide when I was young playing this.),1,2026-02-06 21:05:13
Game is full of cheaters and players that shouldn't have even downloaded the app. You put those two together you have a very annoying gameplay.

Overall a very fun mobile game. Just note that this game has no mercy if you are not pay to win. I would recommend,4,2025-10-30 12:50:03
You ruined this game for more money. You did it for money. Everyone who has money is forced to pay and win. And those who don't have money are stuck in an arena. God will not forgive you. You ruined this game. And those who don't have money are playing it just for nostalgia,1,2025-10-10 05:46:45

There's been very little UNIQUE CONTENT decisions in the last few years, and instead have opted for smaller minor updates.

"What was once an addictive game, with a lot of potential, has turned into complete trash. 2v2 you're either paired with someone with cards too under levelled, or you are paired with someone who ends up quitting 30 seconds in. Don't get too attached to any card, because they'll boost it only to turn around and nerf it into complete trash. This game used to be fun, it used to be great.

"Not a good game ANYMORE. Don't play this if you don't like PAY-TO-WIN games. The season pass just made a lot of players OP for their king level, messing up with already POOR MATCHMAKING SYSTEM, especially on 2v2s. sometimes you'll be up against someone 3 levels higher. How could a king level 8 play against a level 12??!! Also this game takes up to 1.5 GB once you play it. And it crashes frequently even though i have a pretty good phone myself.",1,2019-09-22 07:36:21

In addition, the in game purchase is far too expensive with you having to pay over 10$ minimum for any ""useful"" investment.

There's no new funny decks, there's no more fun, and the pay to win is just on another level, I honestly loved this game, but lately it's been just something else.

Terrible. Gameplay is glitchy. And the game is in general pay to win. Puts you up against easy bots disguised as other players at first and then puts you against player who waste money on the game to get better cards. Have had the game for 1 and a half years and never spent a dime. As well never got a single legendary. Then I bought one chest to prove my theory and that's when I got a legendary. Pay to win.

"The game play is fun but there balancing and match making is awful. You will run into the same type of decks over and over. Also they need to balance cards to balance with other cards and not balance everything on usage rates. Lastly the leave system on ladder is bad especially upper level. In order to be able to run a card in your deck, and have that card be viable, is to have it at +1 to your kings tower level.",1,2021-11-16 12:38:35
Was a very good game untill they made it to were you have to pay money to win with the new update. The champions and the evolutions that they added to the game make you pay money to even have a chance at winning. The passroyal is much worse having less rewards unless you pay money. Over all was a good game but not so much any more. Unless you want to spend money would not recommend.,1,2023-07-06 19:58:25
"Clasg Royale is a beautiful experince. I only give it a 4 for 2 reasons: 1) it heavily relies on paying to be at the top which is very annoying when you rise up in the later ranks. You definitely can earn it, but being someone who loves and plays this gam A LOT, I can tell they really want you to pay. 2) ***Pleas Read Supercell*** the button to queue a chest is RIGHT NEXT to the insta open button that costs Gems.

"I've been playing this game since 2016, with effort and consistency you can easily level cards, and pretty easily obtain the legendary cards especially with the trade system being so fluid. I am almost level 13, with plenty of my cards in my main deck being maxed, the only reason they aren't, is because of time off if there was anything I'd change it would be the amount of legendaries it costs to get to 13, however thats probably just me wanting to max all my cards easier 🤣",5,2021-03-31 02:49:52
Impossible to progress based on skill at a decent rate. No actual balance in the game since the champions and elite cards were added. You shouldn't be mat hee to players with those types of cards if you don't have them. Having the game match me against players with 3 to 4 levels higher than me everytime I get close to a new arena and losing 5 matches in a row because of over leveled cards is actually tiresome. They've stop caring about the game and only care about gimmicks.,1,2023-06-28 04:18:39

Even you're on Arena 2, you can't play normally because there are players who played before and had for example Prince, which is now moved from Training Camp to Arena 7.

Used 2 love this game. Now I consider uninstalling it. No matter what King level my opponent is they always pull out like level 11 P.E.K.K.A or Sparky and I can't do anything about it the 'fair matching' works extremely well. Whoever thought of the new Clan Wars is ridiculous as is the person who accepted the idea. In addition the game does not let you access saved data after uninstall.

"It's basically statistically impossible to get level 15 cards unless you cough up about $60. If your entire collection is level 14, it takes the equivalent of 400,000 common cards to get a level 15 deck. If only your main deck is level 14, it takes millions. An 8-hour gold chest drops about 85 common cards worth. If you do the math, it takes literal years to get to a competitive level. You could always avoid the trophy mode, but this also affects clan war battles. It just isn't worth it.",1,2024-10-03 14:10:15
"Its fun, gets you hooked for countless hours, but theres one major issue. Card levels. These shouldn't be a thing, give advantage to long time players.

"It is the best game in the world. If you aren't sure about playing it just give it a try. The only problem with this game is it is very pay to win, but you still have to have skill.",5,2025-08-27 14:13:20
"used to like this game, but the new updates have completely ruined the game for me and I hate how the devs now prioritize profits over Community kinda hope it ends in there downfall and hopefully Cause them to change",1,2025-11-25 12:19:00
Since the update 2021 the game has become a total waste of time. I suggest other games Update 2022 I uninstalled the game. After finally getting within 8 troops left of being maxed level the game resets its system and now every card was lower levels. Never pay for this game. Only the players with serious cash can keep leveling up and keep it. They'll reset it again in the next few years.,1,2022-01-09 16:17:50
"at the start I thought it was bad but when I played more it became my life, I lost my job for this game",5,2025-12-15 01:26:46
"This may be the first game I have played that continues to get progressivly worse after each update they release. And I have been playing since the beginning.

The game is not worth my rant. The continuous 1-star reviews say it all. Way to ruin a fun game. Update: Tried again 1 year later same stuff play against people ranked way higher or people way lower. fun for the first 4-6 games. great battles then the sh@+ sandwich matchmaking begins. I'd pay for your nifty little chests if you didn't absolutely suck at matching opponents.,1,2025-03-26 10:15:14
"Really fun game, at least at the early levels where everything is balanced, but once you go higher up, the win is decided by who has the most legendary cards or maybe the same cards but at a higher level, since the cards you get are random and have to wait to get more cards unless you buy chests, it's pretty much luck based(does your enemy have 3 low-cost legendaries or does he have any cards at all?)",2,2019-07-01 20:07:52
it keeps lagging and the resolution is not good,3,2026-01-15 07:19:46
"Algorithms won't let you win, delaying cards placements and causing intentional lags all while matching you with exact counters to your decks and higher level 'players' (most likely bots), if you are progressing quickly so as to keep you at a point and spend more money. Anti-skill and extremely greedy hidden mechanisms. Happened to all my friends too. Predatory company.",1,2023-03-09 15:59:50

"Clash Royale was once my favorite game, but now it’s completely pay-to-win. Updates like Level 16 and Heroes, which nobody asked for,clearly favor players who spend money, making ladder progress miserable for free-to-play players unless they grind endlessly. Since the game became popular again, Supercell has clearly focused more on making money than keeping the game fair, which is why I quit this greedy game.",1,2025-12-29 17:24:02
I'd give zero stars if possible been playing the fame 8 years and I have the badge and everything. I hate this game now. there used to be fun and strategy in every ounce of this game but mow it's literally just who has the best hero? you dont? you lose. I hate it. the only way you get anywhere at all is with spending money. out of those 8 years not a single one of my cards have made it past level 13.,1,2025-12-27 14:44:40

"Really takes some serious strategy and there is no real perfect deck which is great. but... I still find it super repetitive in honesty and some cards are overly difficult to counter which can make it very frustrating when you cannot get certain cards. Overall not bad though, definitely worth a download if you haven't tried it.",3,2022-06-28 03:26:53
"Always having bugs. When talking to supercell support team they ask you the same questions, as if they don't read what you are typing.the game is awesome if they can get rid of the problems, 1st problem was dropping out with a red WiFi would come up.and wasn't even using WiFi and had full bars on reception, and couldn't make purchases and for some reason couldn't retrieve my google account. Until I did there games update now I'm having more issues with not winning gold in gold rush from winning",2,2022-04-17 10:50:56

you play against pro and people spend to much money to win and to be toxic i want to give a zero star it use to be fun when you would get a legendary now it boring not fun,1,2025-12-07 14:30:10
"I love this game, it's always fun to play it with friends and there is so much content to it. But there is a point in the game when the progression becomes extremely slow, taking you months to upgrade a single deck and leaving you at a disadvantage for those who have been playing for more time or that choose to spend money on the game. The last updates have been awful and are ruining the progression even more and making it less fun and more unfair for new players, would not recommend",1,2023-06-18 13:52:31
peak my cuz and youtube told me about the game so I downloaded it and its perfect just peak peaaaakkkk,5,2026-02-06 04:17:22
"Fun game, but the developers desperately need to work on matchmaking when it comes to clans. Normal battles are fine, but when I switch to clans, suddenly Im matched against players 2 and 3 levels higher than yourself, which leads to lopsided battles.

you coin give away in boxes stink especially on the playpass side with the amount required to do an upgrade on any troops. get being cheap to the f2p players.. but definitely should be better for those that get the pass,2,2025-10-10 07:56:48

"I've been playing this game for as long as it has been out. You can check my 8 year badge. I was not upset with the tower upgrade, I get it. Was not even mad at a ""season pass"" Pay for it every month. But to add Evo cards and different tower cards that I can only unlock is by paying for it. I'm know longer competitive because the OP tower, and new Evo cards make it impossible. Thanks for running my favorite game.",1,2024-04-25 05:50:54

"I've been playing CR for 9 years, and I finally hit the uninstall button. Clash is VERY pay to win. As a new player, you can't progress unless you drop $50 on evolutions & the battle pass. As an experienced player, whoever buys the newest busted evolutions and abuses them, wins. The most powerful card in the game is your Credit Card. Supercell should be ashamed. What used to be a balanced & fun mobile game, is now one of the most predatory, greedy franchises in mobile gaming. I do NOT recommend.",1,2025-10-22 13:37:01
Use to be a great game but now its unfair as they use tactics similar to betting to try and make you spend actual money. Example is that you can win 5 games in a row against similar levels but then the next 5 games you will be pitted against 2 maybe 3 levels higher than yourself which frustrates you to want to spend real money. Clever by design but you will never win unless you spend.,1,2021-01-06 20:24:02
pretty fun just timer to put down card is kinda slow,5,2025-11-29 12:19:04
It's a really fun addictive game but doesn't increase gold as you lvl up and is very expensive to buy. Makes it very hatd to lvl up characters in the higher lvls and now the game is predictable as to when you get on losing streaks seems to be holding the level down by putting me up against counter decks and slowing down the elixer don't think it's a hack because it always happens right before the next level on all upper levels,3,2021-03-30 22:31:32
cash grab game. it's impossible to get evolves without spending money! terrible game don't waste your time.,1,2025-09-05 11:07:06
"The game became extremely pay to win. Perhaps on lower ladders(level) it's not so noticable but on 10k+ the game becomes suffering. I've played this game almost from it's release with some breaks. Lvl 14 towers and ~18 cards with lvl 14. You can do math if you want, how much time I need to upgrade at least my 2 decks to lvl 15. But every battle I fight against some guy with full lvl 15-16 deck, 2 evolutions and 2 heroes. Maybe skill issue, but even with skill issue it was more enjoyable before",1,2025-12-08 23:36:32

very active games are a perfect match and very comfortable!,5,2025-12-19 18:36:10
"The game is getting worse and worse by each update, becoming more and more pay to win. They just added level 15 to the game and you must pay a fortune to upgrade your level 14 cards to 15. They also almost doubled the price for pass royale and they significantly reduced the amount of prizes you would get by buying it. It's not worth spending anymore, even a dollar. Hope they do something about it or this game will die.",2,2023-06-20 18:38:01
"Update for losers killed the game, Now it's Cash Royale. One day it have 3 rating then they decide to delete some bad reviews to keep them relevant. Really Pathetic from Google and Supercell. 2026 still trash",1,2026-02-01 10:56:01
This game has taken all the joy I once had from playing competitive games. Update after update I regret more and more not quitting this thing but at least it has the Archer Queen and I want to do the no no with her so it's not that bad. When I was younger I used to beat it to the Mini Pekka clapping the Princess but I've changed and the Archer Queen is like 7 feet tall just how I like them this is the best game ever thank you supercell please hire me and give me free gems,5,2026-02-14 09:23:37

"We learned the word ""enshittification"" in English the other day, and I don't think any word describes this game better. The developers have slowly taken almost everything good about this game and ruined it while intentionally ignoring player feedback to make as much money as possible. I cannot recommend this game, and the only reason there is even still a player base is because of copium and because they are all too addicted to stop",1,2026-01-06 14:26:38

Apparently can't play anymore. Try to open game and tells me I need to update. Go to Playstore and there is no update. The decision to increase to level 14 with no compensation for us old players and the amount of gold we spent on upgrading cards is awful. I've been playing for 5 years. I can't spend another year or more now having to grind again to get my already maxed cards maxed again.,1,2021-10-27 18:03:09

this game is one of the best games in the world. as f2p player I really know how the game works pretty easy just place card The game is actually very fun but the edition of heroes just made the game playable for some reason and supercell half to Nerf some cards in the game like... mega Knight if somebody places down a mega Knight and you talking about it in your review just do 🫡 to know that you're cooked also game is absolutely amazing:D,5,2025-12-11 23:54:26

Incredible difficult to start as a beginner lots of peope with alternative accounts so don't expect to do well. It's not fun at all and it takes an extremely long time to get new cards.

You have all these mommy's boys who use her credit card to max out everything, just play classic decks and win. They don't even need to think. They just wait until double elixir to spam. This is really only in higher ranks though, or in the new clan wars. Like I said, the game is really great, but don't download if you're trying to have fun.

no ads fun and addictive soooooooooooo much fun,5,2025-12-20 09:09:49
The card evolutions have 100% ruined the game. No sense of strategy anymore. It's all pay to win and whoever has all the Evos usually gets the victory. Shame on Supercell.,1,2025-12-12 17:32:01
"well the game used to be fun , but as new updates are coming the game is getting worse , it's basically the game for those who pay for leveling up cards , I used to be a huge fan of this game but now it's nothing but trash , you easily get overwhelmed by players cause they pay for the best available there",1,2026-01-27 01:12:33

"Playing games like this where you only need to have a high level set of cards (either through investing time / grinding / or spend money in this game) and doesn't require too much skill is so boring and disappointing. Go play other games that support even newbies by providing them needed in-game heroes/characters etc. so you can play fair and square with other players. In this game, your skills won't matter. Matchmaking sucks. Instead of having fun in this game, you'll only be frustrated.",1,2025-07-12 02:01:29
Best game to play whenever even when your mid match on siege,5,2025-12-16 10:41:54
"Supercell used to stand above the sea of pay-to-win mobile trash. Watching their slow descent into greedy monetization has been rough, but I stuck it out for years. I think back fondly to early Clash of Clans and day-one Clash Royale. It’s sad to see a great studio become a cash grab. The saying is true: you either die a hero or live long enough to become the villain. Skip this unless you want a money-spending simulator.",1,2025-11-25 21:53:57

Always reset setting deck after finish season...,1,2025-12-05 04:39:20
"This game is purely pay-to-win, not strategy-based at all. No matter how good your deck or gameplay is, if your opponent has a higher King Tower level and level 15–16 cards while you’re stuck with level 13 cards because you didn’t pay enough, you’re guaranteed to lose.",1,2026-01-30 23:45:24

"This game is pay to win and spam. It isn't fair with levels. Also you will keep getting people with all the OP cards, even with high elixir all at once and not be able to do anything, there is literally a card with thousands of health and does hundreds of damage and it heals when it kills, and in order to get it you have to play all day every day or just spend money(not only card like that). It used be good, but like all games they ""fixed it when it wasn't broke"". Go back to the old version.",1,2024-10-02 09:30:34

"Re-installed this game after a while, very disappointed with the updates. I find the algorithm to force players to stay longer than originally intended due to poor matchmaking. The programming team has made it clear they want players to spend time trying to return to their original place in ""Trophy Road"". The marketing team on the other hand has made it their sole proprietorship to make players spend as much as possible. Honestly too many bad things to fit into a 500 character review.",1,2023-07-20 09:38:17
its fun and all but its p2w and every time you lose one game you lose 30 trophies like atleast make it less like 10 or 15 not 30 cuz then you played a whole much just to lose it all,2,2025-08-22 19:31:04
"Great game idea, but the pay to win is abhorrent. For the low price of £10 you can pay to just have a better version of a card than anyone else who hasn't also payed £10. You can also pay to have your card at a much higher level than anyone you may face, leading to high power cards just stomping what would normally be their counters.",2,2025-03-10 23:26:40
"It used to be great, then they took the classic ""quantity over quality"" approach, then it was just ok. Now with the newest update, literally EVERYTHING has changed, like it was fine, you could've just added the two cards and move on, but no, you had to swap around the arenas, literally make EVERY legendary card unavailable until arena 10 or something, and the trophy road rewards have been swapped, cards have been ""Adjusted"" etc. Don't bother downloading it, very pay to win as always, but WDYE.",1,2022-10-27 01:58:38

Absolutely great game until they started spamming evolutions and heroes. Once you get to about 8k trophies you HAVE to spend money on the pass every season to have a chance against these P2W players. 3 stars because it used to be the best but is now too monetized.,3,2025-12-19 21:18:28

I couldn't grow my level inspite trying for so long. it just depends on luck on which units you get. the game should be more about strategy but it's about getting lucky and getting better cards, trash 🤮",1,2025-08-31 13:55:31
"Basically, the more trophies you have, the more harder the game will be. The solution is to not get too much trophies to prevent you're enemies from being too strong, and I rarely do the ladder battles instead I do party battles and get new cards by trading what I have for something good. Overall, this is a very good game, matchmaking is quite hard, and it's a perfect way to get new friends. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!👍👍👍👍👍👍",4,2022-01-14 17:49:05

Bad just pain pay to progress/win game.Dont listen to their ad and content creators who dedicated and full time to play this trash game.

"The fundamental game mechanic was revolutionary back in 2016: Supercell had made a truly exceptional game. As is the norm with non-indie studios though, greed ultimately consumed it. From 'adding new levels and down-valuing current ones' type of updates aimed at boosting engagement, to LoL-inspired new character policy (making it too strong so that people will pay to upgrade it), all the way to battle passes' greed has made it clear that supercell wants your money, not your happiness.

I dont know if this is bug or it is made like this only but this is the worst thing about this game. Also creators have made mini Pekka and knight more dangerous by giving them a hero upgrade which is worst if the opposite player has both the hero in his deck.

Don't get this game. It's horribly unbalanced and pay to win. The progression is slow as molasses as you lose almost as much trophies from losing as you gain from winning and half the time you are losing because it's blatantly pay to win. Even without that the game isn't fun there is almost no strategy the higher level always wins.,1,2025-09-26 09:08:49

The only way to get Evolutions is if you buy them which require 6 Evo shards for each card. It cost $5.99 for 3 Evo shards meaning $12 +tax for each Evolution you have.

Now I win only 1 game out of 30 matches. I'm playing lv 10-12 with max level cards. It's completely taken the fun out of the game.

Once upon a time I left a 5 star review for good gameplay and updates but after the recent level 14 cap cash grab I can't recommend the game.

"this game is super rewarding for new players like myself. almost every month a new event is held and they usually give 3 evo shards. Combine that with the free ones from the battle pass I can obtain evolutions ahead of more ""veteran"" players. I do have to agree it becomes more and more p2w when you got onto a more competitive gamemodes, but as a casual player this is definitely a 5* for me",4,2026-01-27 14:18:53

"Clash Royale's matchmaking is a joke. It constantly pairs me with players whose King Tower is one level higher than mine. That single level makes a huge difference! My cards melt faster, and my pushes don't stand a chance. It doesn't feel fair or competitive. Instead of testing skill, it feels like the game is punishing me for not spending more or leveling up faster. Matchmaking needs serious balance!",1,2025-10-14 15:29:40
"Clash Royale's been on the decline for years, but the new update is a nail in the coffin. There are better games to spend your time on. I've been playing this game since day 1 and it was always pay-to-win, but still playable. With recent releases of unbalanced Evos, limited rewards for upgrades, & bad matchmaking, it's lost a lot of what made it fun in the beginning.

"Once somewhat tolerable, Now just pay to win mess. Every opponent uses one of 3 decks, best thing about it is you can't really tailor yours to counter them if you've built a fun or creative deck because the cards needed are often ones you've not used so you can't level them up to be playable.

waste of time this is purely pay to win game if you pay you can save months or years of effort to upgrade a card and when you feel that everything is max nope even tower upgrade takes months or years and then clan wars either you get smashed or you will smash there is no in-between what I mean is if you have level 14 cards then you get enemy at level 15 or enemy at level 13 no in-between and I have played this game for more than 4 years and haven't spent a penny but I could only upgrade 3 cards.,1,2025-10-12 05:46:04

its a overall great game but the pay to win aspects makes it less fun because of the over level troops and free to play people get stuck on lower arenas and seeing that their adding level 16 when no one is asking is horrible. this means they aren't listening to the community and ruining the game. and extra point they are adding heroics so basically more champions and more chaos so they are ruining their fanbase and sometimes making horrible events,3,2025-11-23 11:07:22

"no matter how many cards they add, no matter how many more things they add, If they don't fix the way P2W players play and DESTROY F2P players, it won't be a fun game at all.Seriously, after so many years, they can't make a queue where you only play with people of your same level, or at least 1 level higher at most, not a maxed-out level 15 against a level 11.Another case is the cards,how do you expect me to have a good time if my opponent has maxed out cards, I have to use my 8cards to beat him",1,2025-08-31 22:45:56
"Very fun game! The gameplay and events are very interesting, but there are many things I'd like to see. For example, making pass Royale being able to be bought with gems just like in brawl stars. Another thing is the matchmaking, which quite often puts me up against over leveled players with over leveled cards.

The $5-ish tier was perfect for people who wanted a little more but didn't want to spend a lot, now it's not worth it.

"What was once a strategy and skill game has become a pay to win, who has the most broken cards spam. The devs are truly shameless in making obscenely broken evos and champion and adding new broken spells and nerfing them after the season has ended after theyve made money off of them so they can repeat the cycle next season. game has lost its soul and skill aspect",1,2025-10-16 07:46:28

i like it but every freaking time I'm about to get a new arena I always get someone with level 15 everything of some shi and I'm genuinely crashing out,4,2025-09-27 19:04:47
Too many people exit the game in 2v2 just after the opponent reachs tower my teammates quit it's very frustrating and wasting my time too please ban them for a DAY in 2v2 so they learn not to quit the game,1,2025-09-27 22:37:05

umm i love the game the game play is sooo good but when you take 1 towers and the other player takes 2 towers down. it should take -15 crowns instead of -30 if they take down king and the 2 towers it should be -30 crowns,4,2025-09-15 05:21:50

This game is not for beginners. if you have so much money then you can play this game rather find another game.,1,2025-09-12 10:19:40
its a pay to win game don't bother. you end up going against max lvl people that steam role you. then they sit and emote tea bagging like its some thing special that they drop 100s of bucks behind their deck. there are a couple of better games with out the pay to win wall.,1,2025-11-10 07:55:38

I love this game so much I use to play from 2019.But I don't like the new meta of clash royaleI wanna gives you a idea that what happen if you put 4v4 so we can play with our clanmates and colleagues.I want to say that plz make 4v4 but I know it will be chaos but without princess tower only the 4 king towers will be very coolAlso I think u should give 3 Evo shard in 1 season in pass royale for f2p many players can't afford but they wants to compete with others.Clash Royale plz look upon my idea.,4,2025-09-07 10:49:17

alright don't play this game for many reasons it's paid to win everything people say about this game it's true Don't think it's a fun game because you see the streamers play it it's fun only in the first arena The rest that you get higher up it just gets paid to win people spam nothing is fair You could be in arena 9 and someone would already have every card in the game it's a pathetic stupid game and it's not fair And if you have anger issues for the love of God don't play this shi,1,2025-10-22 04:12:05
